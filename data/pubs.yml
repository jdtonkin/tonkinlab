  title: 'Characterizing fish responses to a river restoration over 21 years based

  title-short: Characterizing fish responses to a river restoration over 21 years
    based on species’ traits
  container-title: Conservation Biology
  page: 1098-1108
  volume: '31'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Understanding restoration effectiveness is often impaired by a lack of
    high-quality, long-term monitoring data and, to date, few researchers have used
    species’ trait information to gain insight into the processes that drive the reaction
    of fish communities to restoration. We examined fish-community responses with
    a highly resolved data set from 21 consecutive years of electrofishing (4 years
    prerestoration and 17 years postrestoration) at multiple restored and unrestored
    reaches from a river restoration project on the Lippe River, Germany. Fish abundance
    peaked in the third year after the restoration; abundance was 6 times higher than
    before the restoration. After 5 years, species richness and abundance stabilized
    at 2 and 3.5 times higher levels relative to the prerestoration level, respectively.
    However, interannual variability of species richness and abundance remained considerable,
    illustrating the challenge of reliably assessing restoration outcomes based on
    data from individual samplings, especially in the first years following restoration.
    Life-history and reproduction-related traits best explained differences in species’
    responses to restoration. Opportunistic short-lived species with early female
    maturity and multiple spawning runs per year exhibited the strongest increase
    in abundance, which reflected their ability to rapidly colonize new habitats.
    These often small-bodied and fusiform fishes typically live in dynamic and ephemeral
    instream and floodplain areas that river-habitat restorations often aim to create,
    and in this case their increases in abundance indicated successful restoration.
    Our results suggest that a greater consideration of species’ traits may enhance
    the causal understanding of community processes and the coupling of restoration
    to functional ecology. Trait-based assessments of restoration outcomes would furthermore
    allow for easier transfer of knowledge across biogeographic borders than studies
    based on taxonomy.

  title: Severity Multipliers as a Methodology to Explore Potential Effects of Climate
    Change on Stream Bioassessment Programs
  container-title: Water
  page: '188'
  volume: '9'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Given the scientific consensus that climate change is impacting biodiversity,
    estimates of future climate change effects on stream communities and assessments
    of potential biases are necessary. Here, we propose a simple technique to approximate
    changes in invertebrate and fish biomonitoring results. Taxa lists for 60 (invertebrate)
    and 52 (fish) sites were each modified by 10 multipliers as stepwise 5% or 10%
    changes in abundances to simulate potential climate-change severity, reflecting
    increasing climate change effects. These 10 multipliers were based on the stream
    zonation preference for invertebrates and the Fish Region Index (FRI) values for
    fish, both reflecting the longitudinal gradient present in river ecosystems. The
    original and modified taxa lists were analyzed using the standard assessment software
    for the particular group, followed by analysis of key biomonitoring metrics. For
    invertebrates, our simulations affected small good quality streams more often
    negatively while large poor mountain streams showed a tendency to improve. Forty
    percent of the invertebrate data sites showed a change in the final ecological
    assessment class when using the multipliers, with the poor quality sites changing
    more often. For fish, metric changes were variable, but the FRI ratio showed mostly
    positive responses, i.e., a shift in FRI towards downstream communities. The results
    are discussed as an example that facilitates the interpretation of potential climate-change
    effects with varying severity. Further, we discuss the simplified approach and
    implications for assessment from climate change induced range shifts.

  title: Revisiting global trends in freshwater insect biodiversity

  issue: '2'
  annote: '\_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wat2.1506'
  abstract: 'A recent global meta-analysis reported a decrease in terrestrial but
    increase in freshwater insect abundance and biomass (van Klink et al., Science
    368, p. 417). The authors suggested that water quality has been improving, thereby
    challenging recent reports documenting drastic global declines in freshwater biodiversity.
    We raise two major concerns with the meta-analysis and suggest that these account
    for the discrepancy with the declines reported elsewhere. First, total abundance
    and biomass alone are poor indicators of the status of freshwater insect assemblages,
    and the observed differences may well have been driven by the replacement of sensitive
    species with tolerant ones. Second, many of the datasets poorly represent global
    trends and reflect responses to local conditions or nonrandom site selection.
    We conclude that the results of the meta-analysis should not be considered indicative
    of an overall improvement in the condition of freshwater ecosystems. This article
    is categorized under: Water and Life $>$ Conservation, Management, and Awareness'

  page: 368-387
  volume: '94'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Species reintroductions the translocation of individuals to areas in which
    a species has been extirpated with the aim of re-establishing a self-sustaining
    population have become a widespread practice in conservation biology. Reintroduction
    projects have tended to focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, to a lesser extent,
    fishes. Much less effort has been devoted to the reintroduction of invertebrates
    into restored freshwater habitats. Yet, reintroductions may improve restoration
    outcomes in regions where impoverished regional species pools limit the self-recolonisation
    of restored freshwaters. We review the available literature on macroinvertebrate
    reintroductions, focusing on identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that
    determine their success or failure. Our study reveals that freshwater macroinvertebrate
    reintroductions remain rare, are often published in the grey literature and, of
    the attempts made, approximately one-third fail. We identify life-cycle complexity
    and remaining stressors as the two factors most likely to affect reintroduction
    success, illustrating the unique challenges of freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions.
    Consideration of these factors by managers during the planning process and proper
    documentation even if a project fails may increase the likelihood of successful
    outcomes in future reintroduction attempts of freshwater macroinvertebrates.

  container-title: Science of The Total Environment

  volume: '536'
  abstract: It is broadly acknowledged that freshwater ecosystems are affected by
    multiple stressors, but the relative importance of individual stressors in impairing
    riverine communities remains unclear. We investigated the impacts of multiple
    stressors, incorporating in-stream water quality, riparian and catchment land
    use and stream morphology, on riverine benthic invertebrate communities, while
    considering the spatial scales of factors and the heterogeneity of riverscapes.
    We performed a stepwise regression procedure linking 21 abiotic and 20 community
    metrics using Generalized Linear Models on data from 1018 river sites spread across
    Germany. High impact stressors (e.g., nutrients and water temperature) were identified
    for various community metrics. Both the combination of relevant stressors and
    their explanatory value differed significantly across streams of different sizes
    and ecoregions. In large rivers, the riparian land use was less important in determining
    community structure compared to lower order streams. Thus, possible mitigating
    effects of revegetated riparian buffer strips are likely to be overwhelmed by
    the influence of catchment-wide land use. Our results indicated substantial variability
    in stressors for the range of metrics studied, providing insight into potential
    target parameters for effective ecosystem management. To achieve long lasting
    successes in managing, protecting and restoring running waters, it is of vital
    importance to recognize the heterogeneity of riverscapes and to consider large-scale
    influences.

  title: Dispersal capacity and broad-scale landscape structure shape benthic invertebrate
    communities along stream networks
  container-title: Limnologica
  page: 68-74
  volume: '71'
  abstract: 'Dispersal is a fundamental trait influencing species distribution patterns
    and metacommunity structure. Yet, for stream communities it remains unclear how
    communities differ in dispersal capacity. Due to the dendritic network structure
    of streams and the greater spatial variability in environmental conditions in
    headwaters than in mainstems, we asked three main questions: 1) Do benthic invertebrates
    inhabiting headwaters have lower community-wide dispersal capacities (DCc) on
    average than those living in mainstems? 2) In turn, does the degree of community
    dissimilarity among sites differ between the different locations in the river
    network? 3) Are these differences more pronounced in highland streams compared
    to lowland streams as a consequence of major landscape features (i.e. mountains)?
    To examine these questions, we compiled 1466 benthic invertebrate samples across
    the southern highland and northern lowland areas of Germany. Results showed that
    overall DCc increased with stream size in both highland and lowland streams. In
    highland streams, higher DCc in mainstems was associated with more homogeneous
    communities compared to headwater communities. However, this pattern did not occur
    in lowland streams. This suggests that both dispersal capacity and landscape structure
    interact to determine community structure in these networks. Our results therefore
    stress the importance of considering dispersal traits and landscape features,
    as well as habitat control (or environmental filtering) to better understand (meta-)
    community structure across various landscape types.'

  title: The effects of abiotic and biotic factors on taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity
    of stream epilithic bacteria around Qiandao Lake
  container-title: Aquatic Sciences
  page: '71'
  volume: '82'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Stream bacterial communities are shaped by a combination of local and
    regional processes, such as environmental filtering, biotic interactions and dispersal,
    but biotic interactions have received comparatively less attention. Here, we investigated
    stream bacterial alpha and beta diversity within taxonomic and phylogenetic contexts
    around Qiandao Lake in China. We further examined abiotic and biotic factors on
    bacterial communities by explicitly considering biotic variables including macroinvertebrate
    species richness, total cover of periphyton and submerged macrophytes. For alpha
    and beta diversity, there were consistently high correlations between taxonomic
    and observed phylogenetic metrics. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity could
    be explained by abiotic and biotic variables, though the former showed a stronger
    influence. Using a null model to break down the association between species phylogeny
    and co-occurrence, we found non-significant correlations for alpha and beta diversity
    between taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, that is, the standardized effect
    size of phylogenetic diversity (ses.PD) or Unifrac dissimilarity (ses.Unifrac).
    Variations in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity at both alpha and beta levels
    were mainly explained by pure effect of abiotic variables. Biotic variables, such
    as macroinvertebrate species richness and total cover of periphyton, significantly
    explained the variations in ses.PD and ses.Unifrac by 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively.
    Our findings provide an evidence that biotic variables play a non-negligible role
    in structuring bacterial communities and help to better understand the potential
    role of biological interactions across trophic levels in streams.

  title: Local contribution to beta diversity is negatively linked with community-wide
    dispersal capacity in stream invertebrate communities
  container-title: Ecological Indicators
  page: '105715'
  volume: '108'
  abstract: 'It is increasingly well understood that stream communities are regulated
    by both local niche and regional dispersal processes, but comprehensive tests
    of these factors with datasets that cover extensive spatial and temporal scales
    are rare. Based on 1180 benthic invertebrate community samples from 2005 to 2012
    in central low mountain streams of Germany, we tested the hypotheses that: 1)
    local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD: a measure of the uniqueness of communities)
    would decline with increasing average community dispersal capacity; and 2) owing
    to the relatively large spatial extent of the study region, regional dispersal
    processes would override local niche controls in structuring community composition.
    We found considerable temporal variation in LCBD and a negative correlation between
    LCBD and community dispersal capacity. However, no statistically significant correlation
    between species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) and species dispersal capacity
    was observed. The large-scale spatial structure among locations (representative
    of dispersal limitation) was important in structuring benthic communities. Although
    much of the variation was explained by the shared effects of local processes and
    large-scale spatial variables, environmental controls were stronger than regional
    processes in few cases in the variance partitioning analysis, with the annual
    mean temperature and mean diurnal range of temperature being the important drivers.
    Given the highly varied correlates of beta diversity over time, we urge researchers
    to focus on not only spatial variation in diversity, but also the context of temporal
    variation.'

  container-title: Science of The Total Environment

  abstract: Environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation are important drivers
    of beta diversity; however, their relative influence on the two fundamental components
    of beta diversity (i.e., species replacement and richness difference) has not
    been fully examined in montane streams. Here, we examined the relative importance
    of local environmental gradients and three physical distance matrices (i.e., overland,
    watercourse and cost distances) on beta diversity and its two components for a
    macroinvertebrate metacommunity in a stream network. To provide additional insights
    into community assembly, we also analysed variation in two deconstructed sub-communities
    based on dispersal ability (i.e., weak and strong dispersers). Both environmental
    filters and physical distances (dispersal limitation) drove patterns of overall
    beta diversity, with the former generally prevailing over the latter. Species
    replacement components showed stronger correlations with environmental gradients
    than physical distances, while the opposite is true for the richness difference
    components. Overland distances were generally more important than cost and watercourse
    distances for community dissimilarity of stream macroinvertebrates, implying that
    lateral dispersal out of stream corridors through flight was the major dispersal
    route in the studied steam network. As expected, community dissimilarity of strong
    dispersers was primarily shaped by environmental filtering, while community dissimilarity
    of weak dispersers was associated with the joint effects of environmental filtering
    and dispersal limitation. Our findings demonstrate that partitioning overall dissimilarity
    into species replacement and richness difference provides more insights into the
    processes driving spatial variability in biological communities compared with
    the utilization of total beta diversity alone. Our results support the notion
    that maintaining environmental heterogeneity and natural connectivity of stream
    networks should be effective measures to conserve regional biodiversity.

    approach'
  title-short: Linking river flow regimes to riparian plant guilds
  container-title: Ecological Applications
  page: 1338-1350
  volume: '27'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: 'Modeling riparian plant dynamics along rivers is complicated by the fact
    that plants have different edaphic and hydrologic requirements at different life
    stages. With intensifying human demands for water and continued human alteration
    of rivers, there is a growing need for predicting responses of vegetation to flow
    alteration, including responses related to climate change and river flow management.
    We developed a coupled structured population model that combines stage-specific
    responses of plant guilds with specific attributes of river hydrologic regime.
    The model uses information on the vital rates of guilds as they relate to different
    hydrologic conditions (flood, drought, and baseflow), but deliberately omits biotic
    interactions from the structure (interaction neutral). Our intent was to (1) consolidate
    key vital rates concerning plant population dynamics and to incorporate these
    data into a quantitative framework, (2) determine whether complex plant stand
    dynamics, including biotic interactions, can be predicted from basic vital rates
    and river hydrology, and (3) project how altered flow regimes might affect riparian
    communities. We illustrated the approach using five flow- response guilds that
    encompass much of the river floodplain community: hydroriparian tree, xeroriparian
    shrub, hydroriparian shrub, mesoriparian meadow, and desert shrub. We also developed
    novel network-b ased tools for predicting community-w ide effects of climate-d
    riven shifts and deliberately altered flow regimes. The model recovered known
    patterns of hydroriparian tree vs. xeroriparian shrub dominance, including the
    relative proportion of these two guilds as a function of river flow modification.
    By simulating flow alteration scenarios ranging from increased drought to shifts
    in flood timing, the model predicted that mature hydroriparian forest should be
    most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Multiguild sensitivity analysis
    identified substantial network connectivity (many connected nodes) and biotic
    linkage (strong pairwise connections between nodes) under natural flow regime
    conditions. Both connectivity and linkage were substantially reduced under drought
    and other flow- alteration scenarios, suggesting that community structure is destabilized
    under such conditions. This structured population modeling approach provides a
    useful tool for understanding the community-w ide effects of altered flow regimes
    due to climate change and management actions that influence river flow regime.'

  volume: '20'

  abstract: Disturbances cause high mortality in populations while simultaneously
    enhancing population growth by improving habitats. These countervailing effects
    make it difficult to predict population dynamics following disturbance events.
    To address this challenge, we derived a novel form of the logistic growth equation
    that permits time-varying carrying capacity and growth rate. We combined this
    equation with concepts drawn from disturbance ecology to create a general model
    for population dynamics in disturbance-prone systems. A river flooding example
    using three insect species (a fast life-cycle mayfly, a slow life-cycle dragonfly
    and an ostracod) found optimal tradeoffs between disturbance frequency vs. magnitude
    and a close fit to empirical data in 62% of cases. A savanna fire analysis identified
    fire frequencies of 3 years that maximised population size of a perennial grass.
    The model shows promise for predicting population dynamics after multiple disturbance
    events and for management of river flows and fire regimes.

  abstract: Global change is increasing biotic homogenization globally, which modifies
    the functioning of ecosystems. While tendencies towards taxonomic homogenization
    in biological communities have been extensively studied, functional homogenization
    remains an understudied facet of biodiversity. Here, we tested four hypotheses
    related to long-term changes (1991) in the taxonomic and functional arrangement
    of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages across space and possible drivers
    of these changes. Using data collected annually at 64 river sites in mainland
    New Zealand, we related temporal changes in taxonomic and functional spatial $\beta$-diversity,
    and the contribution of individual sites to $\beta$-diversity, to a set of global,
    regional, catchment and reach-scale environmental descriptors. We observed long-term,
    mostly climate-induced, temporal trends towards taxonomic homogenization but functional
    differentiation among macroinvertebrate assemblages. These changes were mainly
    driven by replacements of species and functional traits among assemblages, rather
    than nested species loss. In addition, there was no difference between the mean
    rate of change in the taxonomic and functional facets of $\beta$-diversity. Climatic
    processes governed overall population and community changes in these freshwater
    ecosystems, but were amplified by multiple anthropogenic, topographic and biotic
    drivers of environmental change, acting widely across the landscape. The functional
    diversification of communities could potentially provide communities with greater
    stability, resistance and resilience capacity to environmental change, despite
    ongoing taxonomic homogenization. Therefore, our study highlights a need to further
    understand temporal trajectories in both taxonomic and functional components of
    species communities, which could enable a clearer picture of how biodiversity
    and ecosystems will respond to future global changes.

  title: Diverging response patterns of terrestrial and aquatic species to hydromorphological
    restoration
  container-title: Conservation Biology
  page: 132-141
  volume: '33'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Although experiences with ecological restoration continue to accumulate,
    the effectiveness of restoration for biota remains debated. We complemented a
    traditional taxonomic analysis approach with information on 56 species traits
    to uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes)
    and 2 terrestrial (carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic groups to 43
    hydromorphological river restoration projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups
    responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness
    (10%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life history,
    and feeding groups) (15%). Responses, however, were stronger for terrestrial than
    aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger
    than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis provided mechanistic insights
    into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for
    terrestrial biota indicated restoration success was likely enhanced by lateral
    connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker
    response of aquatic biota suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of
    stressors in the aquatic environment, such as degraded water quality, dispersal
    constraints, and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration
    requires combined localand regional-scale approaches to maximize the response
    of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to the contrasting responses of
    aquatic and terrestrial biota, the planning and assessment of river restoration
    outcomes should consider effects on both components of riverine landscapes.

  title: Novel Insights to Be Gained From Applying Metacommunity Theory to Long-Term,
    Spatially Replicated Biodiversity Data
  container-title: Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution
  publisher: Frontiers
  volume: '8'
  abstract: Global loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services are occurring
    at an alarming rate. Metacommunity theory provides a framework to investigate
    multi-scale processes that drive change in biodiversity across space and time.
    Short-term ecological studies across space have progressed our understanding of
    biodiversity through a metacommunity lens, however, have been limited in their
    ability to explain which processes, at which scales, generate observed spatial
    patterns. Large gaps in theory and empirical data in temporal dynamics of metacommunities
    have hindered progress in our understanding of underlying metacommunity processes
    that give rise to biodiversity patterns. Fortunately, long-term studies with cross-scale
    spatial replication can provide a means to gain a deeper understanding of the
    multiscale processes driving biodiversity patterns in time and space to inform
    metacommunity theory. The maturation of coordinated research and observation networks,
    such as the U.S. Long-Term Ecological Research program, provides an opportunity
    to advance explanation and prediction of biodiversity change with observational
    and experimental data at spatial and temporal scales greater than any single research
    group could accomplish. Synthesis of Long Term Ecological Research network community
    datasets illustrates that many long-term studies with spatial replication present
    an unutilized empirical resource for advancing spatiotemporal metacommunity research.
    We identify challenges to synthesizing these data and present recommendations
    for addressing them with insights about how future monitoring efforts by coordinated
    research and observation networks might better promote future integration of data
    across space and time to further the development of metacommunity theory and its
    applications aimed at improving conservation efforts.

  container-title: Ecosphere
  page: e02681
  volume: '10'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Understanding how novel biological assemblages are structured in relation
    to dynamic environmental regimes remains a central challenge in ecology. Demographic
    approaches to modeling species assemblages show promise because they seek to represent
    fundamental relationships between population dynamics and environmental conditions.
    In dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions have shifted drought and
    flooding regimes with implications for fish communities. Our goals were to (1)
    develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic model that links native and nonnative
    species with river flow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic responses in population
    and community structure to changing flow regimes. Each fish species was represented
    by a stage-structured matrix, and species were coupled together into a multispecies
    framework through density-dependent relationships in reproduction. Then, community
    dynamics were simulated through time using annual flow events classified from
    gaged streamflow data. We parameterized the model with vital rates and flowresponse
    relationships for a community of native and nonnative fishes using literature-derived
    values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde River (Arizona, USA), a major
    tributary within the Colorado River Basin, for the past half century (1964). Model
    validation revealed a match between model projections and relative abundance trends
    observed in a long-term fish monitoring dataset (1994). At the beginning of the
    validation period (1994), model and survey observations showed that native species
    comprised approximately 80% of total abundance. Model projections beyond the survey
    data (2008) predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant assemblage,
    coinciding with increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between native and nonnative
    species dominance emerged from differences in mortality in response to the changing
    sequence of major flow events including spring floods, summer high flows, and
    droughts. In conclusion, the demographic approach presented here provides a flexible
    modeling framework that is readily applied to other stream systems and species
    by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate, species vital rates and flow-event
    thresholds.

  abstract: Composition and structure of lotic ecosystems can be affected by substrate
    instability. Consequently stream ecologists have used various methods to determine
    bed stability characteristics. However, the link between community composition
    and these measurements varies because benthic biota often responds to combinations
    of bed stability characteristics. This paper presents a protocol to determine
    reach-scale stream bed stability in mountain streams which is relevant for invertebrate
    communities (Stream Bed Stability for Invertebrates, SBSI). The approach is calibrated
    on community composition response to bed stability but does not measure any single
    bed stability characteristic per se. It consists of 13 parameters that are assessed
    once at each reach with minimal instrumentation and low interference with the
    substrate. These 13 parameters cover aspects of sediment supply from banks, transport
    capacity and substrate erodibility as well as effects of particle transport on
    channel bottom structures, substrate assemblage and single grains. Application
    of the SBSI protocol improved the relationship between bed stability and community
    diversity compared to when conventional bed stability measures were employed.
    The SBSI protocol provides a cost-effective and time-effective assessment method
    for bed stability and its application can facilitate research on invertebrate
    community response to physical disturbance. Copyright 2011 John Wiley & Sons,

  title: Global patterns and drivers of ecosystem functioning in rivers and riparian
    zones
  container-title: Science Advances
  page: eaav0486
  volume: '5'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: River ecosystems receive and process vast quantities of terrestrial organic
    carbon, the fate of which depends strongly on microbial activity. Variation in
    and controls of processing rates, however, are poorly characterized at the global
    scale. In response, we used a peer-sourced research network and a highly standardized
    carbon processing assay to conduct a global-scale field experiment in greater
    than 1000 river and riparian sites. We found that Earth’s biomes have distinct
    carbon processing signatures. Slow processing is evident across latitudes, whereas
    rapid rates are restricted to lower latitudes. Both the mean rate and variability
    decline with latitude, suggesting temperature constraints toward the poles and
    greater roles for other environmental drivers (e.g., nutrient loading) toward
    the equator. These results and data set the stage for unprecedented “next-generation
    biomonitoring” by establishing baselines to help quantify environmental impacts
    to the functioning of ecosystems at a global scale.

  title: 'Invertebrate drift patterns in a regulated river: Dams, periphyton biomass
    or longitudinal patterns?'
  title-short: Invertebrate drift patterns in a regulated river
  container-title: River Research and Applications
  page: 1219-1231
  volume: '25'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Macroinvertebrate drift was sampled at 15 sites along the Tongariro River,
    New Zealand above and below two hydroelectric dams. Sixty-seven invertebrate taxa
    were collected in the drift. Trichoptera (31) were the most diverse, followed
    by Diptera (13), Ephemeroptera (8) and Plecoptera (8). However, chironomidae were
    the numerically dominant taxa in the drift throughout the river and represented
    over 80% of all animals collected. Of these, Orthocladiinae and Diamesinae were
    the most abundant. Taxonomic richness declined with distance downstream and peaked
    at sites with intermediate levels of periphyton biomass. The per cent of Ephemeroptera,
    Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) was 3 times higher in the unregulated section
    of the river and declined exponentially with both distance downstream and increase
    in periphyton biomass, but densities were similar along the river. Of the measured
    environmental variables periphyton biomass was most closely linked with drift
    community structure. Periphyton biomass was six times higher in the lower section
    of the river than the upper unregulated section. The autocorrelation between periphyton
    biomass and distance downstream complicates the interpretation of results. However,
    because of the distinct differences between above and below dam sections of river
    in periphyton biomass and the strong link between it and invertebrate drift we
    suggest that the alteration of flow patterns by the hydroelectric dams and the
    associated shift in periphyton biomass is the most likely explanation for invertebrate
    drift patterns in the river. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

  title: Consistent effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity between landscapes
  container-title: Ecosphere
  page: art108
  volume: '3'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Productivity and disturbance have a strong role in determining diversity
    patterns in nature yet whether they operate individually or interact to determine
    diversity is unclear. Moreover, what effect land-use change has on this relationship
    has not been assessed. We tested whether land use influenced the relationship
    between productivity, disturbance and diversity, and assessed the fit of three
    productivitydisturbance-diversity models, using data from multiple samplings of
    16 streams in two contrasting regions of the North Island of New Zealand. As the
    Dynamic Equilibrium Model (DEM) has received inconsistent support in all ecosystems
    and little favorable applications in lotic systems, we applied this along with
    two previously developed for stream communities. Although the community structure
    differed between the two regions, the response of taxonomic richness to productivity
    and disturbance was consistent. That is, richness was log-linearly related to
    productivity and declined monotonically with disturbance. However, there was no
    evidence of an interactive effect of productivity and disturbance. When accounting
    for density (rarefaction) the results were inconsistent, exhibiting no relationship
    with productivity but declining with disturbance. Our results suggest both the
    Death and Tonkin productivity-disturbance-diversity models are the most applicable
    in these communities where disturbance simply removes taxa and productivity controls
    the upper limit to richness.

  volume: '4'

  abstract: The application of mussel spat rope for enabling the passage of redfin
    bully Gobiomorphus huttoni through culverts, which create velocity barriers, was
    trialled in the laboratory. No fish were able to access the un-roped control pipes
    whereas 52% successfully negotiated the pipes in the rope treatments. The success
    of fish ascending treatment pipes suggests mussel spat rope may be effective for
    enabling the passage of this and other similar fish species through otherwise
    impassable culverts with velocity barriers.

  container-title: Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv für Hydrobiologie
  page: 231-245
  volume: '182'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Downstream drift plays a fundamental role in the spatial distribution
    and community structure of lotic macroinvertebrates. We sampled both benthic and
    drifting macroinvertebrates at 15 sites, in three sections of river with varying
    flow alteration along the Tongariro River, New Zealand. Our objectives were to
    examine whether (i) benthic and drift density were linearly related throughout
    the river, (ii) the presence of dams affected the propensity of macroinvertebrates
    to drift, and (iii) drift propensity was related to benthic periphyton biomass
    or natural longitudinal patterns down the river. More taxa were collected from
    the drift than the benthos, although drift and benthic samples were generally
    taxonomically similar, despite some structural differences. Nonetheless, differences
    were evident between the major groups when assessing density and relative abundance
    links between the benthos and drift. The presence of dams did not affect the propensity
    of macroinvertebrates to drift on the whole, nor was propensity affected by periphyton
    biomass or distance from source. These results suggest that although altered periphyton
    biomass in downstream sections in the Tongariro River is altering the composition
    of benthic and drifting macroinvertebrates, drift propensity is unaffected. However,
    some deviations from linear relationships between benthic and drift density are
    evident suggesting these links may be taxon specific.

  title: Scale dependent effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity in streams
  container-title: Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv für Hydrobiologie
  page: 283-295
  volume: '182'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity vary widely with
    the spatial scale at which they are examined. Not only do productivity and disturbance
    have strong influences on diversity patterns at local and regional scales but
    they can affect the way in which communities assemble and in turn alter beta diversity
    or community dissimilarity. We assessed whether the form of both the productivity-
    and disturbance-diversity relationships differed between the spatial scale at
    which they were examined using experimental stream channels in three Hawke’s Bay,
    New Zealand streams. In place of true local and regional richness, we used the
    proxies within- and between-stream richness, as well as assessing between-stream
    community dissimilarity (similar to beta diversity). Our results indicate that
    productivity and disturbance both affect diversity but at individual scales and
    in different forms. At the within-stream scale, richness was a u shaped function
    of productivity whereas at the between-stream scale richness increased monotonically
    with increasing productivity. Community dissimilarity on the other hand, increased
    monotonically with increasing rate of disturbance. Rather than a greater role
    of deterministic assembly with increasing disturbance, our results indicate the
    opposite, but it appears that communities are simply converging on those found
    in the surrounding streambed with time since disturbance. Specifically, communities
    were more similar within individual streams than within disturbance treatments
    and animals colonizing post-disturbance were simply a subset of taxa present at
    each site regardless of perceived colonizing ability, rather than a suite of specialist
    colonizing taxa. These results demonstrate that without a distinction between
    early and late colonizers, a greater rate of deterministic assembly at high disturbance
    will not occur.

  title: 'The combined effects of flow regulation and an artificial flow release on

    on a regulated river
  container-title: River Research and Applications
  page: 329-337
  volume: '30'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Damming and regulating the flow of rivers is a widespread issue and can
    have a significant impact on resident biota. The Tongariro River, central North
    Island, New Zealand, has a flow regime that is regulated by two hydroelectric
    dams along its length, and it has been suggested that ‘flushing flows’ would assist
    benthic communities by removing ‘nuisance’ periphyton growth forms that typically
    occur in autumn. We assessed whether (i) damming has altered periphyton and macroinvertebrate
    communities downstream of the Rangipo Dam and (ii) whether the release of a flow
    pulse equivalent to 50 times the baseflow is sufficient to (a) move the substrate
    in the section of river downstream of this dam and (b) impact benthic periphyton
    and macroinvertebrate communities. Downstream macroinvertebrate communities were
    impacted by the presence of the dam, but periphyton was not. No movement of substrate
    occurred downstream of the dam as a result of the flow release, which was likely
    because of naturally high embeddedness and armouring of substrate. Periphyton
    biomass and macroinvertebrate density were not affected by the release indicating
    that larger releases would be required to have any effect on benthic communities
    downstream of this dam. This study highlights the importance of considering natural
    bed structure and sediment dynamics when using flow releases downstream of dams
    to control periphyton. Copyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

  title: Drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure in unmodified streams
  container-title: PeerJ
  page: e465
  volume: '2'
  abstract: 'Often simple metrics are used to summarise complex patterns in stream
    benthic ecology, thus it is important to understand how well these metrics can
    explain the finer-scale underlying environmental variation often hidden by coarser-scale
    influences. I sampled 47 relatively pristine streams in the central North Island
    of New Zealand in 2007 and (1) evaluated the local-scale drivers of macroinvertebrate
    community structure as well as both diversity and biomonitoring metrics in this
    unmodified landscape, and (2) assessed whether these drivers were similar for
    commonly used univariate metrics and multivariate structure. The drivers of community
    metrics and multivariate structure were largely similar, with % canopy cover and
    resource supply metrics the most commonly identified environmental drivers in
    these pristine streams. For an area with little to no anthropogenic influence,
    substantial variation was explained in the macroinvertebrate community (up to
    70% on the first two components of a partial least squares regression), with both
    uni- and multivariate approaches. This research highlights two important points:
    (1) the importance of considering natural underlying environmental variation when
    assessing the response to coarse environmental gradients, and (2) the importance
    of considering canopy cover presence when assessing the impact of stressors on
    stream macroinvertebrate communities.'

  page: '818'
  volume: '65'

  abstract: There is little consensus on the form of the periphyton biomassmacroinvertebrate
    diversity relationship in streams. One factor that these relationships do not
    account for is the growth form of primary producers. We (1) examined the periphyton
    biomassmacroinvertebrate diversity relationship in 24 streams of Cantabria, Spain,
    in July 2007, and (2) determined whether this relationship was underpinned, and
    better explained, by specific responses to the growth form of the periphyton community.
    We hypothesised that macroinvertebrate diversity would be a log-linear function
    of periphyton biomass and would respond differently to two coarse divisions of
    the periphytic community; i.e. positively to %cover of non-filamentous algae and
    negatively to %cover of streaming filamentous algae. There was no relationship
    between benthic periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate diversity in these streams
    but, as predicted, this relationship was underpinned by responses to the growth
    form of periphyton community. Generally, macroinvertebrate diversity responded
    positively to %cover of non-filaments and negatively to %cover of streaming filaments,
    although results were variable. These findings suggest that periphyton biomassmacroinvertebrate
    diversity relationships in streams can be underpinned by interactions with specific
    growth forms of periphyton. We suggest that further research is required to develop
    robust thresholds of %cover of filamentous algae cover that would benefit managers
    wishing to minimise negative effects of eutrophication on stream communities.

  title: The Rise of Riverine Flow-ecology and Environmental Flow Research
  container-title: Environmental Processes
  page: 323-330
  volume: '1'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Rivers worldwide are under increasing threat from hydrologic alteration.
    Managing for environmental flows (E-flows) is one way of dealing with this, but
    research remains heavily focused on development of methods for setting flows.
    We examined trends in riverine flow-ecology research (the link between the flow
    regime and biota of a river) from 1995 to 2012 internationally by assessing publication
    rate of all countries combined and identifying trends in research specifically
    on E-flows. USA dominated the research output in flow-ecology research, but Australian
    researchers were the most active on E-flows. We show that E-flow research has
    exponentially expanded since the mid 1990s, both in number and as a percentage
    of general river research. Eflow research productivity also increased weakly with
    the number of dams and per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of countries, highlighting
    that this research is performed mostly in developed countries. We expect this
    trend will continue and suggest that E-flow research needs to be incorporated
    into policy in low-GDP countries to ensure healthy viable river ecosystems.

  title: Climatic and Catchment-Scale Predictors of Chinese Stream Insect Richness
    Differ between Taxonomic Groups
  container-title: PLOS ONE
  page: e0123250
  volume: '10'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Little work has been done on large-scale patterns of stream insect richness
    in China. We explored the influence of climatic and catchment-scale factors on
    stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) richness across mid-latitude
    China. We assessed the predictive ability of climatic, catchment land cover and
    physical structure variables on genus richness of EPT, both individually and combined,
    in 80 mid-latitude Chinese streams, spanning a 3899-m altitudinal gradient. We
    performed analyses using boosted regression trees and explored the nature of their
    influence on richness patterns. The relative importance of climate, land cover,
    and physical factors on stream insect richness varied considerably between the
    three orders, and while important for Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, latitude did
    not improve model fit for any of the groups. EPT richness was linked with areas
    comprising high forest cover, elevation and slope, large catchments and low temperatures.
    Ephemeroptera favoured areas with high forest cover, medium-to-large catchment
    sizes, high temperature seasonality, and low potential evapotranspiration. Plecoptera
    richness was linked with low temperature seasonality and annual mean, and high
    slope, elevation and warm-season rainfall. Finally, Trichoptera favoured high
    elevation areas, with high forest cover, and low mean annual temperature, seasonality
    and aridity. Our findings highlight the variable role that catchment land cover,
    physical properties and climatic influences have on stream insect richness. This
    is one of the first studies of its kind in Chinese streams, thus we set the scene
    for more in-depth assessments of stream insect richness across broader spatial
    scales in China, but stress the importance of improving data availability and
    consistency through time.

  title: Seasonality and predictability shape temporal species diversity
  container-title: Ecology
  page: 1201-1216
  volume: '98'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong
    controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the
    predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways
    that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-n
    ested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both
    seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability
    (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions.
    Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a
    framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and
    applied this using global long-term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that
    temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal
    climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower
    diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case
    study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community
    turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability
    (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities
    in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in
    community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across
    seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated
    randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of
    environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding
    of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these
    trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty
    of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations
    for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment)
    spanning gradients of climatic variability.

  title: Do latitudinal gradients exist in New Zealand stream invertebrate metacommunities?
  container-title: PeerJ
  page: e4898
  volume: '6'
  abstract: That biodiversity declines with latitude is well known, but whether a
    metacommunity process is behind this gradient has received limited attention.
    We tested the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is progressively replaced by
    mass effects with increasing latitude, along with a series of related hypotheses.
    We explored these hypotheses by examining metacommunity structure in stream invertebrate
    metacommunities spanning the length of New Zealand’s two largest islands ($\sim$1,300
    km), further disentangling the role of dispersal by deconstructing assemblages
    into strong and weak dispersers. Given the highly dynamic nature of New Zealand
    streams, our alternative hypothesis was that these systems are so unpredictable
    (at different stages of post-flood succession) that metacommunity structure is
    highly context dependent from region to region. We rejected our primary hypotheses,
    pinning this lack of fit on the strong unpredictability of New Zealand’s dynamic
    stream ecosystems and fauna that has evolved to cope with these conditions. While
    local community structure turned over along this latitudinal gradient, metacommunity
    structure was highly context dependent and dispersal traits did not elucidate
    patterns. Moreover, the emergent metacommunity types exhibited no trends, nor
    did the important environmental variables. These results provide a cautionary
    tale for examining singular metacommunities. The considerable level of unexplained
    contingency suggests that any inferences drawn from one-off snapshot sampling
    may be misleading and further points to the need for more studies on temporal
    dynamics of metacommunity processes.

    observation data in Europe'
  title-short: Unlocking biodiversity data
  container-title: Biological Conservation
  page: 78-85
  volume: '221'
  abstract: Large quantities of biodiversity data are required to assess the current
    status of species, to identify drivers of population and distributional change,
    and to predict changes to biodiversity under future scenarios. Nevertheless, currently-available
    data are often not well-suited to these purposes. To highlight existing gaps,
    we assess the availability of species observation data in Europe, their geographic
    and temporal range, and their quality. We do so by reviewing the most relevant
    sources for European biodiversity observation data, and identifying important
    barriers to filling gaps. We suggest strategies, tools and frameworks to continue
    to fill these gaps, in addition to producing data suitable for generating Essential
    Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). Our review of data sources shows that only around
    a third of data-providers provide unrestricted data access. Particularly large
    geographic gaps exist in Eastern European countries and many datasets are not
    suitable for generating EBVs due to the absence of long-term data. We highlight
    examples built on recent experiences from large data integrators, publishers and
    networks that help to efficiently improve data availability, adopt open science
    principles and close existing data gaps. Future strategies must urgently consider
    the needs of relevant data stakeholders, particularly science- and policy-related
    needs, and provide incentives for data-providers. Hence, sustainable, longterm
    infrastructures and a European biodiversity network are needed to provide such
    efficient workflows, incentives for data-provision and tools.

  title: Urbanization Impacts the Physicochemical Characteristics and Abundance of
    Fecal Markers and Bacterial Pathogens in Surface Water
  container-title: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
  page: '1739'
  volume: '16'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Urbanization is increasing worldwide and is happening at a rapid rate
    in China in line with economic development. Urbanization can lead to major changes
    in freshwater environments through multiple chemical and microbial contaminants.
    We assessed the impact of urbanization on physicochemical characteristics and
    microbial loading in canals in Suzhou, a city that has experienced rapid urbanization
    in recent decades. Nine sampling locations covering three urban intensity classes
    (high, medium and low) in Suzhou were selected for field studies and three locations
    in Huangshan (natural reserve) were included as pristine control locations. Water
    samples were collected for physicochemical, microbiological and molecular analyses.
    Compared to medium and low urbanization sites, there were statistically significant
    higher levels of nutrients and total and thermotolerant coliforms (or fecal coliforms)
    in highly urbanized locations. The effect of urbanization was also apparent in
    the abundances of human-associated fecal markers and bacterial pathogens in water
    samples from highly urbanized locations. These results correlated well with land
    use types and anthropogenic activities at the sampling sites. The overall results
    indicate that urbanization negatively impacts water quality, providing high levels
    of nutrients and a microbial load that includes fecal markers and pathogens.
