  {"id":"datry23causes","abstract":"Rivers that do not flow year-round are the predominant type of running waters on Earth. Despite a burgeoning literature on natural flow intermittence (NFI), knowledge about the hydrological causes and ecological effects of human-induced, anthropogenic flow intermittence (AFI) remains limited. NFI and AFI could generate contrasting hydrological and biological responses in rivers because of distinct underlying causes of drying and evolutionary adaptations of their biota. We first review the causes of AFI and show how different anthropogenic drivers alter the timing, frequency and duration of drying, compared with NFI. Second, we evaluate the possible differences in biodiversity responses, ecological functions, and ecosystem services between NFI and AFI. Last, we outline knowledge gaps and management needs related to AFI. Because of the distinct hydrologic characteristics and ecological impacts of AFI, ignoring the distinction between NFI and AFI could undermine management of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams and exacerbate risks to the ecosystems and societies downstream.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Datry","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Truchy","given":"Amélie"},{"family":"Olden","given":"Julian D"},{"family":"Busch","given":"Michelle H"},{"family":"Stubbington","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Dodds","given":"Walter K"},{"family":"Zipper","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Songyan"},{"family":"Messager","given":"Mathis L"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Kendra E"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"John C"},{"family":"Moody","given":"Eric K"},{"family":"Burrows","given":"Ryan M"},{"family":"Sarremejane","given":"Romain"},{"family":"DelVecchia","given":"Amanda G"},{"family":"Fork","given":"Megan L"},{"family":"Little","given":"Chelsea J"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Richard H"},{"family":"Walters","given":"Annika W"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"datry23causes","container-title":"BioScience","DOI":"10.1093/biosci/biac098","ISSN":"0006-3568, 1525-3244","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,11]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"9-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Causes, responses, and implications of anthropogenic versus natural flow intermittence in river networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/73/1/9/6835545","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"graham21generalizable","abstract":"Disturbances fundamentally alter ecosystem functions, yet predicting their impacts remains a key scientific challenge. While the study of disturbances is ubiquitous across many ecological disciplines, there is no agreed-upon, cross-disciplinary foundation for discussing or quantifying the complexity of disturbances, and no consistent terminology or methodologies exist. This inconsistency presents an increasingly urgent challenge due to accelerating global change and the threat of interacting disturbances that can destabilize ecosystem responses. By harvesting the expertise of an interdisciplinary cohort of contributors spanning 42 institutions across 15 countries, we identified an essential limitation in disturbance ecology: the word ‘disturbance’ is used interchangeably to refer to both the events that cause, and the consequences of, ecological change, despite fundamental distinctions between the two meanings. In response, we developed a generalized framework of ecosystem disturbances to reconcile this limitation, providing a well-defined lexicon for understanding disturbance across perspectives and scales. The framework results from ideas that resonate across multiple scientific disciplines and provides a baseline standard to compare disturbances across fields. This framework can be supplemented by discipline-specific variables to provide maximum benefit to both inter- and intra-disciplinary research. To support future synthesis or meta-analysis of disturbance research, we also encourage researchers to be explicit in how they define disturbance drivers and impacts, recommend minimum reporting standards that studies should detail about the magnitude, duration, and rate of change of driver and response variables of a disturbance, regardless of scale. We discuss the primary factors we considered when developing a baseline framework and propose four future directions to advance our interdisciplinary understanding of disturbances and their social-ecological impacts: integrating across ecological scales, understanding disturbance interactions, establishing baselines and trajectories, and developing process-based models and ecological forecasting initiatives. Our experience through this process motivates us to encourage the wider scientific community to continue to explore new approaches for leveraging Open Science principles in generating creative and multidisciplinary ideas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Emily B."},{"family":"Averill","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Bond-Lamberty","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Knelman","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Krause","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Peralta","given":"Ariane L."},{"family":"Shade","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Smith","given":"A.

  {"id":"grigoropoulou23global","abstract":"Motivation Aquatic insects comprise 64% of freshwater animal diversity and are widely used as bioindicators to assess water quality impairment and freshwater ecosystem health, as well as to test ecological hypotheses. Despite their importance, a comprehensive, global database of aquatic insect occurrences for mapping freshwater biodiversity in macroecological studies and applied freshwater research is missing. We aim to fill this gap and present the Global EPTO Database, which includes worldwide geo-referenced aquatic insect occurrence records for four major taxa groups: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata (EPTO). Main type of variables contained A total of 8,368,467 occurrence records globally, of which 8,319,689 (99%) are publicly available. The records are attributed to the corresponding drainage basin and sub-catchment based on the Hydrography90m dataset and are accompanied by the elevation value, the freshwater ecoregion and the protection status of their location. Spatial location and grain The database covers the global extent, with 86% of the observation records having coordinates with at least four decimal digits (11.1 m precision at the equator) in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) coordinate reference system. Time period and grain Sampling years span from 1951 to 2021. Ninety-nine percent of the records have information on the year of the observation, 95% on the year and month, while 94% have a complete date. In the case of seven sub-datasets, exact dates can be retrieved upon communication with the data contributors. Major taxa and level of measurement Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata, standardized at the genus taxonomic level. We provide species names for 7,727,980 (93%) records without further taxonomic verification. Software format The entire tab-separated value (.csv) database can be downloaded and visualized at https://glowabio.org/project/epto_database/. Fifty individual datasets are also available at https://fred.igb-berlin.de, while six datasets have restricted access. For the latter, we share metadata and the contact details of the authors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Grigoropoulou","given":"Afroditi"},{"family":"Hamid","given":"Suhaila Ab"},{"family":"Acosta","given":"Raúl"},{"family":"Akindele","given":"Emmanuel Olusegun"},{"family":"Al-Shami","given":"Salman A."},{"family":"Altermatt","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Amatulli","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Angeler","given":"David G."},{"family":"Arimoro","given":"Francis O."},{"family":"Aroviita","given":"Jukka"},{"family":"Astorga-Roine","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Rafael Costa"},{"family":"Bonada","given":"Núria"},{"family":"Boukas","given":"Nikos"},{"family":"Brand","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Bremerich","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Bush","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Callisto","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Cruz","given":"Paulo Vilela"},{"family":"Dangles","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiling"},{"family":"Domínguez","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Dudgeon","given":"David"},{"family":"Eriksen","given":"Tor Erik"},{"family":"Faria","given":"Ana Paula J."},{"family":"Feio","given":"Maria João"},{"family":"Fernández-Aláez","given":"Camino"},{"family":"Floury","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"García-Criado","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"García-Girón","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Graf","given":"Wolfram"},{"family":"Grönroos","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hamada","given":"Neusa"},{"family":"He","given":"Fengzhi"},{"family":"Heino","given":"Jani"},{"family":"Holzenthal","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Huttunen","given":"Kaisa-Leena"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Jähnig","given":"Sonja C."},{"family":"Jetz","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Richard K."},{"family":"Juen","given":"Leandro"},{"family":"Kalkman","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Kati","given":"Vassiliki"},{"family":"Keke","given":"Unique N."},{"family":"Koroiva","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Kuemmerlen","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Langhans","given":"Simone Daniela"},{"family":"Ligeiro","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Van Looy","given":"Kris"},{"family":"Maasri","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Marchant","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Garcia Marquez","given":"Jaime Ricardo"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Renato T."},{"family":"Melo","given":"Adriano S."},{"family":"Metzeling","given":"Leon"},{"family":"Miserendino","given":"Maria Laura"},{"family":"Moe","given":"S.

Accelerating environmental challenges increases the need to focus synthesis science on the most pressing questions. To leverage input from the broader research community, we convened a virtual workshop with participants from many countries and disciplines to examine how and where synthesis can address key questions and themes in ecology and environmental science in the coming decade. Seven priority research topics emerged: (1) diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ), (2) human and natural systems, (3) actionable and use-inspired science, (4) scale, (5) generality, (6) complexity and resilience, and (7) predictability. Additionally, two issues regarding the general practice of synthesis emerged: the need for increased participant diversity and inclusive research practices; and increased and improved data flow, access, and skill-building. These topics and practices provide a strategic vision for future synthesis in ecology and environmental science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Halpern","given":"Benjamin S."},{"family":"Boettiger","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Dietze","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Gephart","given":"Jessica A."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Grimm","given":"Nancy B."},{"family":"Groffman","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Gurevitch","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Hobbie","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Komatsu","given":"Kimberly J."},{"family":"Kroeker","given":"Kristy J."},{"family":"Lahr","given":"Heather J."},{"family":"Lodge","given":"David M."},{"family":"Lortie","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Lowndes","given":"Julie S.

  {"id":"hockendorff17characterizing","abstract":"Understanding restoration effectiveness is often impaired by a lack of high-quality, long-term monitoring data and, to date, few researchers have used species’ trait information to gain insight into the processes that drive the reaction of fish communities to restoration. We examined fish-community responses with a highly resolved data set from 21 consecutive years of electrofishing (4 years prerestoration and 17 years postrestoration) at multiple restored and unrestored reaches from a river restoration project on the Lippe River, Germany. Fish abundance peaked in the third year after the restoration; abundance was 6 times higher than before the restoration. After 5–7 years, species richness and abundance stabilized at 2 and 3.5 times higher levels relative to the prerestoration level, respectively. However, interannual variability of species richness and abundance remained considerable, illustrating the challenge of reliably assessing restoration outcomes based on data from individual samplings, especially in the first years following restoration. Life-history and reproduction-related traits best explained differences in species’ responses to restoration. Opportunistic short-lived species with early female maturity and multiple spawning runs per year exhibited the strongest increase in abundance, which reflected their ability to rapidly colonize new habitats. These often small-bodied and fusiform fishes typically live in dynamic and ephemeral instream and floodplain areas that river-habitat restorations often aim to create, and in this case their increases in abundance indicated successful restoration. Our results suggest that a greater consideration of species’ traits may enhance the causal understanding of community processes and the coupling of restoration to functional ecology. Trait-based assessments of restoration outcomes would furthermore allow for easier transfer of knowledge across biogeographic borders than studies based on taxonomy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Höckendorff","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bunzel-Drüke","given":"Margret"},{"family":"Zimball","given":"Olaf"},{"family":"Scharf","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Stoll","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"hockendorff17characterizing","container-title":"Conservation Biology","container-title-short":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12908","ISSN":"08888892","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1098-1108","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characterizing fish responses to a river restoration over 21 years based on species’ traits: Fish Responses to River Restoration","title-short":"Characterizing fish responses to a river restoration over 21 years based on species’ traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/cobi.12908","volume":"31"},

Here, we propose a simple technique to approximate changes in invertebrate and ﬁsh biomonitoring results. Taxa lists for 60 (invertebrate) and 52 (ﬁsh) sites were each modiﬁed by 10 multipliers as stepwise 5% or 10% changes in abundances to simulate potential climate-change severity, reﬂecting increasing climate change effects. These 10 multipliers were based on the stream zonation preference for invertebrates and the Fish Region Index (FRI) values for ﬁsh, both reﬂecting the longitudinal gradient present in river ecosystems. The original and modiﬁed taxa lists were analyzed using the standard assessment software for the particular group, followed by analysis of key biomonitoring metrics. For invertebrates, our simulations affected small good quality streams more often negatively while large poor mountain streams showed a tendency to improve. Forty percent of the invertebrate data sites showed a change in the ﬁnal ecological assessment class when using the multipliers, with the poor quality sites changing more often. For ﬁsh, metric changes were variable, but the FRI ratio showed mostly positive responses, i.e., a shift in FRI towards downstream communities. The results are discussed as an example that facilitates the interpretation of potential climate-change effects with varying severity. Further, we discuss the simpliﬁed approach and implications for assessment from climate change induced range shifts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jähnig","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Gies","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Domisch","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Hering","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"jahnig17severity","container-title":"Water","container-title-short":"Water","DOI":"10.3390/w9040188","ISSN":"2073-4441","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"188","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Severity Multipliers as a Methodology to Explore Potential Effects of Climate Change on Stream Bioassessment Programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/4/188","volume":"9"},

We raise two major concerns with the meta-analysis and suggest that these account for the discrepancy with the declines reported elsewhere. First, total abundance and biomass alone are poor indicators of the status of freshwater insect assemblages, and the observed differences may well have been driven by the replacement of sensitive species with tolerant ones. Second, many of the datasets poorly represent global trends and reflect responses to local conditions or nonrandom site selection.

Reintroduction projects have tended to focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, to a lesser extent, ﬁshes. Much less effort has been devoted to the reintroduction of invertebrates into restored freshwater habitats. Yet, reintroductions may improve restoration outcomes in regions where impoverished regional species pools limit the self-recolonisation of restored freshwaters. We review the available literature on macroinvertebrate reintroductions, focusing on identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine their success or failure. Our study reveals that freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions remain rare, are often published in the grey literature and, of the attempts made, approximately one-third fail. We identify life-cycle complexity and remaining stressors as the two factors most likely to affect reintroduction success, illustrating the unique challenges of freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions. Consideration of these factors by managers during the planning process and proper documentation – even if a project fails – may increase the likelihood of successful outcomes in future reintroduction attempts of freshwater macroinvertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jourdan","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Plath","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Ceylan","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Dumeier","given":"Arlena C."},{"family":"Gellert","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Graf","given":"Wolfram"},{"family":"Hawkins","given":"Charles P."},{"family":"Kiel","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Lorenz","given":"Armin W."},{"family":"Matthaei","given":"Christoph D."},{"family":"Verdonschot","given":"Piet F.

We investigated the impacts of multiple stressors, incorporating in-stream water quality, riparian and catchment land use and stream morphology, on riverine benthic invertebrate communities, while considering the spatial scales of factors and the heterogeneity of riverscapes. We performed a stepwise regression procedure linking 21 abiotic and 20 community metrics using Generalized Linear Models on data from 1018 river sites spread across Germany. High impact stressors (e.g., nutrients and water temperature) were identiﬁed for various community metrics. Both the combination of relevant stressors and their explanatory value differed signiﬁcantly across streams of different sizes and ecoregions. In large rivers, the riparian land use was less important in determining community structure compared to lower order streams. Thus, possible mitigating effects of revegetated riparian buffer strips are likely to be overwhelmed by the inﬂuence of catchment-wide land use. Our results indicated substantial variability in stressors for the range of metrics studied, providing insight into potential target parameters for effective ecosystem management. To achieve long lasting successes in managing, protecting and restoring running waters, it is of vital importance to recognize the heterogeneity of riverscapes and to consider large-scale inﬂuences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Leps","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Dahm","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Sundermann","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"leps15disentangling","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.083","ISSN":"00489697","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","page":"546-556","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Disentangling environmental drivers of benthic invertebrate assemblages: The role of spatial scale and riverscape heterogeneity in a multiple stressor environment","title-short":"Disentangling environmental drivers of benthic invertebrate assemblages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969715304290","volume":"536"},

Here, we provide a conceptual framework describing how ecological forecasts can energize and advance ecological theory. We emphasize the many opportunities for future progress in this area through increased forecast development, comparison and synthesis. Our framework describes how a forecasting approach can shed new light on existing ecological theories while also allowing researchers to address novel questions. Through rigorous and repeated testing of hypotheses, forecasting can help to refine theories and understand their generality across systems. Meanwhile, synthesizing across forecasts allows for the development of novel theory about the relative predictability of ecological variables across forecast horizons and scales.

Yet, for stream communities it remains unclear how communities diﬀer in dispersal capacity. Due to the dendritic network structure of streams and the greater spatial variability in environmental conditions in headwaters than in mainstems, we asked three main questions: 1) Do benthic invertebrates inhabiting headwaters have lower community-wide dispersal capacities (DCc) on average than those living in mainstems? 2) In turn, does the degree of community dissimilarity among sites diﬀer between the diﬀerent locations in the river network? 3) Are these diﬀerences more pronounced in highland streams compared to lowland streams as a consequence of major landscape features (i.e. mountains)? To examine these questions, we compiled 1466 benthic invertebrate samples across the southern highland and northern lowland areas of Germany. Results showed that overall DCc increased with stream size in both highland and lowland streams. In highland streams, higher DCc in mainstems was associated with more homogeneous communities compared to headwater communities. However, this pattern did not occur in lowland streams. This suggests that both dispersal capacity and landscape structure interact to determine community structure in these networks. Our results therefore stress the importance of considering dispersal traits and landscape features, as well as habitat control (or environmental ﬁltering) to better understand (meta-) community structure across various landscape types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Fengqing"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"li18dispersal","container-title":"Limnologica","container-title-short":"Limnologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.limno.2018.06.003","ISSN":"00759511","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7]]},"language":"en","page":"68-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dispersal capacity and broad-scale landscape structure shape benthic invertebrate communities along stream networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0075951118300793","volume":"71"},

Here, we investigated stream bacterial alpha and beta diversity within taxonomic and phylogenetic contexts around Qiandao Lake in China. We further examined abiotic and biotic factors on bacterial communities by explicitly considering biotic variables including macroinvertebrate species richness, total cover of periphyton and submerged macrophytes. For alpha and beta diversity, there were consistently high correlations between taxonomic and observed phylogenetic metrics. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity could be explained by abiotic and biotic variables, though the former showed a stronger influence. Using a null model to break down the association between species phylogeny and co-occurrence, we found non-significant correlations for alpha and beta diversity between taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, that is, the standardized effect size of phylogenetic diversity (ses.PD) or Unifrac dissimilarity (ses.Unifrac). Variations in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity at both alpha and beta levels were mainly explained by pure effect of abiotic variables. Biotic variables, such as macroinvertebrate species richness and total cover of periphyton, significantly explained the variations in ses.PD and ses.Unifrac by 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively.

  {"id":"li20local","abstract":"It is increasingly well understood that stream communities are regulated by both local niche and regional dispersal processes, but comprehensive tests of these factors with datasets that cover extensive spatial and temporal scales are rare. Based on 1180 benthic invertebrate community samples from 2005 to 2012 in central low mountain streams of Germany, we tested the hypotheses that: 1) local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD: a measure of the uniqueness of communities) would decline with increasing average community dispersal capacity; and 2) owing to the relatively large spatial extent of the study region, regional dispersal processes would override local niche controls in structuring community composition. We found considerable temporal variation in LCBD and a negative correlation between LCBD and community dispersal capacity. However, no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) and species dispersal capacity was observed. The large-scale spatial structure among locations (representative of dispersal limitation) was important in structuring benthic communities. Although much of the variation was explained by the shared eﬀects of local processes and large-scale spatial variables, environmental controls were stronger than regional processes in few cases in the variance partitioning analysis, with the annual mean temperature and mean diurnal range of temperature being the important drivers. Given the highly varied correlates of beta diversity over time, we urge researchers to focus on not only spatial variation in diversity, but also the context of temporal variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Fengqing"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"li20local","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105715","ISSN":"1470160X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105715","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Local contribution to beta diversity is negatively linked with community-wide dispersal capacity in stream invertebrate communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X19307083","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"li21distance","abstract":"Environmental heterogeneity and dispersal limitation are important drivers of beta diversity; however, their relative influence on the two fundamental components of beta diversity (i.e., species replacement and richness difference) has not been fully examined in montane streams. Here, we examined the relative importance of local environmental gradients and three physical distance matrices (i.e., overland, watercourse and cost distances) on beta diversity and its two components for a macroinvertebrate metacommunity in a stream network. To provide additional insights into community assembly, we also analysed variation in two deconstructed sub-communities based on dispersal ability (i.e., weak and strong dispersers). Both environmental filters and physical distances (dispersal limitation) drove patterns of overall beta diversity, with the former generally prevailing over the latter. Species replacement components showed stronger correlations with environmental gradients than physical distances, while the opposite is true for the richness difference components. Overland distances were generally more important than cost and watercourse distances for community dissimilarity of stream macroinvertebrates, implying that lateral dispersal out of stream corridors through flight was the major dispersal route in the studied steam network. As expected, community dissimilarity of strong dispersers was primarily shaped by environmental filtering, while community dissimilarity of weak dispersers was associated with the joint effects of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation. Our findings demonstrate that partitioning overall dissimilarity into species replacement and richness difference provides more insights into the processes driving spatial variability in biological communities compared with the utilization of total beta diversity alone. Our results support the notion that maintaining environmental heterogeneity and natural connectivity of stream networks should be effective measures to conserve regional biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zhengfei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xiaoming"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Xie","given":"Zhicai"},{"family":"Heino","given":"Jani"}],"citation-key":"li21distance","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143630","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"143630","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Distance decay of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in a mountain river network: Do dispersal routes and dispersal ability matter?","title-short":"Distance decay of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in a mountain river network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720371618","volume":"758"},
  {"id":"li22seasonal","abstract":"To improve our understanding on the temporal aspects of metacommunity structure, we focused on benthic macroinvertebrates collected seasonally (i.e., wet, drying, dry and rewetting seasons) in Dongting Lake, a large subtropical floodplain lake in China. We employed the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework and variation partitioning to examine whether metacommunity structure and its underlying mechanisms vary among seasons with distinct biotic and abiotic features. We found gradual shifts in the main assembly mechanisms throughout the year, from apparent spatial structuring (potentially indicative of mass effects) in the wet season to more environmental filtering dynamics in the dry season. When the degree of connectivity was high in the wet season, the benthic metacommunity was characterized by nested structure associated with clumped species loss, and was shaped mainly by spatial processes. However, quasi-Clemensian structure was assigned to metacommunities in the transitional seasons with intermediate connectivity, during which environmental variables were more important than spatial factors in describing community structure. When the degree of connectivity was low in the dry season, the benthic metacommunity displayed Clementsian structure, which was configured solely by environmental variables. The rapid shifts in metacommunity dynamics between seasons mainly result from the considerable changes in the hydrological conditions of Dongting Lake, as the studied system varies from lacustrine to fluvial phases within a single year. Taken together, our results revealed that taking temporal aspects into account gives a better insight into metacommunity organization, especially when the studied systems embrace remarkable variability in hydrological regimes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Zhengfei"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xingliang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhenyuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Junqian"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Zhicai"},{"family":"Heino","given":"Jani"}],"citation-key":"li22seasonal","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108662","ISSN":"1470-160X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"108662","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Seasonal variation in the metacommunity structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in a large river-connected floodplain lake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22001339","volume":"136"},
  {"id":"lytle17linking","abstract":"Modeling riparian plant dynamics along rivers is complicated by the fact that plants have different edaphic and hydrologic requirements at different life stages. With intensifying human demands for water and continued human alteration of rivers, there is a growing need for predicting responses of vegetation to flow alteration, including responses related to climate change and river flow management. We developed a coupled structured population model that combines stage-s­pecific responses of plant guilds with specific attributes of river hydrologic regime. The model uses information on the vital rates of guilds as they relate to different hydrologic conditions (flood, drought, and baseflow), but deliberately omits biotic interactions from the structure (interaction neutral). Our intent was to (1) consolidate key vital rates concerning plant population dynamics and to incorporate these data into a quantitative framework, (2) determine whether complex plant stand dynamics, including biotic interactions, can be predicted from basic vital rates and river hydrology, and (3) project how altered flow regimes might affect riparian communities. We illustrated the approach using five flow-­ response guilds that encompass much of the river floodplain community: hydroriparian tree, xeroriparian shrub, hydroriparian shrub, mesoriparian meadow, and desert shrub. We also developed novel network-b­ ased tools for predicting community-w­ ide effects of climate-d­ riven shifts and deliberately altered flow regimes. The model recovered known patterns of hydroriparian tree vs. xeroriparian shrub dominance, including the relative proportion of these two guilds as a function of river flow modification. By simulating flow alteration scenarios ranging from increased drought to shifts in flood timing, the model predicted that mature hydroriparian forest should be most abundant near the observed natural flow regime. Multiguild sensitivity analysis identified substantial network connectivity (many connected nodes) and biotic linkage (strong pairwise connections between nodes) under natural flow regime conditions. Both connectivity and linkage were substantially reduced under drought and other flow-­ alteration scenarios, suggesting that community structure is destabilized under such conditions. This structured population modeling approach provides a useful tool for understanding the community-w­ ide effects of altered flow regimes due to climate change and management actions that influence river flow regime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lytle","given":"David A."},{"family":"Merritt","given":"David M."},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Olden","given":"Julian D."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Lindsay V."}],"citation-key":"lytle17linking","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecol Appl","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1528","ISSN":"10510761","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"1338-1350","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Linking river flow regimes to riparian plant guilds: a community-wide modeling approach","title-short":"Linking river flow regimes to riparian plant guilds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/eap.1528","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"mouton20increasing","abstract":"Global change is increasing biotic homogenization globally, which modifies the functioning of ecosystems. While tendencies towards taxonomic homogenization in biological communities have been extensively studied, functional homogenization remains an understudied facet of biodiversity. Here, we tested four hypotheses related to long-term changes (1991–2016) in the taxonomic and functional arrangement of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages across space and possible drivers of these changes. Using data collected annually at 64 river sites in mainland New Zealand, we related temporal changes in taxonomic and functional spatial β-diversity, and the contribution of individual sites to β-diversity, to a set of global, regional, catchment and reach-scale environmental descriptors. We observed long-term, mostly climate-induced, temporal trends towards taxonomic homogenization but functional differentiation among macroinvertebrate assemblages. These changes were mainly driven by replacements of species and functional traits among assemblages, rather than nested species loss. In addition, there was no difference between the mean rate of change in the taxonomic and functional facets of β-diversity. Climatic processes governed overall population and community changes in these freshwater ecosystems, but were amplified by multiple anthropogenic, topographic and biotic drivers of environmental change, acting widely across the landscape. The functional diversification of communities could potentially provide communities with greater stability, resistance and resilience capacity to environmental change, despite ongoing taxonomic homogenization. Therefore, our study highlights a need to further understand temporal trajectories in both taxonomic and functional components of species communities, which could enable a clearer picture of how biodiversity and ecosystems will respond to future global changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mouton","given":"Théophile L."},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Stephenson","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Verburg","given":"Piet"},{"family":"Floury","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"mouton20increasing","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15389","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"6904-6915","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Increasing climate-driven taxonomic homogenization but functional differentiation among river macroinvertebrate assemblages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15389","volume":"26"},

We further examined changes in population size and range shifts of species pools, and related these to taxonomy and functional traits. We found increasing climate and land-use driven differences in both the taxonomic and functional composition of communities over time, coupled with poleward species colonisations and increasing extirpations in northern locations. Increases in population and species range size were more prevalent than decreases in population and range size. Species shifted their ranges towards higher latitudes on average by 50 km per decade. Despite little to no relationship with taxonomy, we uncovered distinct relationships between functional traits and population trends and latitudinal species range shifts. Species with a high number of reproductive cycles per year and long-life duration of adults tended to increase their population size, while larger size species with a high number of descendants per reproductive cycle tended to shift their range towards more southern latitudes.

All taxonomic groups responded positively to restoration, as shown by increased taxonomic richness (10–164%) and trait diversity (habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life history, and feeding groups) (15–120%). Responses, however, were stronger for terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger than those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of community change following restoration. Trait analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration success was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of stressors in the aquatic environment, such as degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore, river restoration requires combined localand regional-scale approaches to maximize the response of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Metacommunity theory provides a framework to investigate multi-scale processes that drive change in biodiversity across space and time. Short-term ecological studies across space have progressed our understanding of biodiversity through a metacommunity lens, however, have been limited in their ability to explain which processes, at which scales, generate observed spatial patterns. Large gaps in theory and empirical data in temporal dynamics of metacommunities have hindered progress in our understanding of underlying metacommunity processes that give rise to biodiversity patterns. Fortunately, long-term studies with cross-scale spatial replication can provide a means to gain a deeper understanding of the multiscale processes driving biodiversity patterns in time and space to inform metacommunity theory. The maturation of coordinated research and observation networks, such as the U.S. Long-Term Ecological Research program, provides an opportunity to advance explanation and prediction of biodiversity change with observational and experimental data at spatial and temporal scales greater than any single research group could accomplish. Synthesis of Long Term Ecological Research network community datasets illustrates that many long-term studies with spatial replication present an unutilized empirical resource for advancing spatiotemporal metacommunity research.

  {"id":"rogosch19increasing","abstract":"Understanding how novel biological assemblages are structured in relation to dynamic environmental regimes remains a central challenge in ecology. Demographic approaches to modeling species assemblages show promise because they seek to represent fundamental relationships between population dynamics and environmental conditions. In dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions have shifted drought and ﬂooding regimes with implications for ﬁsh communities. Our goals were to (1) develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river ﬂow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic responses in population and community structure to changing ﬂow regimes. Each ﬁsh species was represented by a stage-structured matrix, and species were coupled together into a multispecies framework through density-dependent relationships in reproduction. Then, community dynamics were simulated through time using annual ﬂow events classiﬁed from gaged streamﬂow data. We parameterized the model with vital rates and ﬂow–response relationships for a community of native and nonnative ﬁshes using literature-derived values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde River (Arizona, USA), a major tributary within the Colorado River Basin, for the past half century (1964–2017). Model validation revealed a match between model projections and relative abundance trends observed in a long-term ﬁsh monitoring dataset (1994–2008). At the beginning of the validation period (1994), model and survey observations showed that native species comprised approximately 80% of total abundance. Model projections beyond the survey data (2008–2017) predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant assemblage, coinciding with increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between native and nonnative species dominance emerged from differences in mortality in response to the changing sequence of major ﬂow events including spring ﬂoods, summer high ﬂows, and droughts. In conclusion, the demographic approach presented here provides a ﬂexible modeling framework that is readily applied to other stream systems and species by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate, species vital rates and ﬂow-event thresholds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogosch","given":"Jane S."},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Lytle","given":"David A."},{"family":"Merritt","given":"David M."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Lindsay V."},{"family":"Olden","given":"Julian D."}],"citation-key":"rogosch19increasing","container-title":"Ecosphere","container-title-short":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.2681","ISSN":"2150-8925, 2150-8925","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"language":"en","page":"e02681","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Increasing drought favors nonnative fishes in a dryland river: evidence from a multispecies demographic model","title-short":"Increasing drought favors nonnative fishes in a dryland river","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.2681","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"schwendel12new","abstract":"Composition and structure of lotic ecosystems can be affected by substrate instability. Consequently stream ecologists have used various methods to determine bed stability characteristics. However, the link between community composition and these measurements varies because benthic biota often responds to combinations of bed stability characteristics. This paper presents a protocol to determine reach-scale stream bed stability in mountain streams which is relevant for invertebrate communities (Stream Bed Stability for Invertebrates, SBSI). The approach is calibrated on community composition response to bed stability but does not measure any single bed stability characteristic per se. It consists of 13 parameters that are assessed once at each reach with minimal instrumentation and low interference with the substrate. These 13 parameters cover aspects of sediment supply from banks, transport capacity and substrate erodibility as well as effects of particle transport on channel bottom structures, substrate assemblage and single grains. Application of the SBSI protocol improved the relationship between bed stability and community diversity compared to when conventional bed stability measures were employed. The SBSI protocol provides a cost-effective and time-effective assessment method for bed stability and its application can facilitate research on invertebrate community response to physical disturbance.

We found that Earth’s biomes have distinct carbon processing signatures. Slow processing is evident across latitudes, whereas rapid rates are restricted to lower latitudes. Both the mean rate and variability decline with latitude, suggesting temperature constraints toward the poles and greater roles for other environmental drivers (e.g., nutrient loading) toward the equator.

  {"id":"tonkin09invertebrate","abstract":"Macroinvertebrate drift was sampled at 15 sites along the Tongariro River, New Zealand above and below two hydroelectric dams. Sixty-seven invertebrate taxa were collected in the drift. Trichoptera (31) were the most diverse, followed by Diptera (13), Ephemeroptera (8) and Plecoptera (8). However, chironomidae were the numerically dominant taxa in the drift throughout the river and represented over 80% of all animals collected. Of these, Orthocladiinae and Diamesinae were the most abundant. Taxonomic richness declined with distance downstream and peaked at sites with intermediate levels of periphyton biomass. The per cent of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) was 3–4 times higher in the unregulated section of the river and declined exponentially with both distance downstream and increase in periphyton biomass, but densities were similar along the river. Of the measured environmental variables periphyton biomass was most closely linked with drift community structure. Periphyton biomass was six times higher in the lower section of the river than the upper unregulated section. The autocorrelation between periphyton biomass and distance downstream complicates the interpretation of results. However, because of the distinct differences between above and below dam sections of river in periphyton biomass and the strong link between it and invertebrate drift we suggest that the alteration of ﬂow patterns by the hydroelectric dams and the associated shift in periphyton biomass is the most likely explanation for invertebrate drift patterns in the river.

Moreover, what effect land-use change has on this relationship has not been assessed. We tested whether land use influenced the relationship between productivity, disturbance and diversity, and assessed the fit of three productivitydisturbance-diversity models, using data from multiple samplings of 16 streams in two contrasting regions of the North Island of New Zealand. As the Dynamic Equilibrium Model (DEM) has received inconsistent support in all ecosystems and little favorable applications in lotic systems, we applied this along with two previously developed for stream communities. Although the community structure differed between the two regions, the response of taxonomic richness to productivity and disturbance was consistent. That is, richness was log-linearly related to productivity and declined monotonically with disturbance. However, there was no evidence of an interactive effect of productivity and disturbance. When accounting for density (rarefaction) the results were inconsistent, exhibiting no relationship with productivity but declining with disturbance. Our results suggest both the Death and Tonkin productivity-disturbance-diversity models are the most applicable in these communities where disturbance simply removes taxa and productivity controls the upper limit to richness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell G."}],"citation-key":"tonkin12consistent","container-title":"Ecosphere","container-title-short":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1890/ES12-00243.1","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"art108","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Consistent effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity between landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/ES12-00243.1","volume":"3"},

We sampled both benthic and drifting macroinvertebrates at 15 sites, in three sections of river with varying flow alteration along the Tongariro River, New Zealand. Our objectives were to examine whether (i) benthic and drift density were linearly related throughout the river, (ii) the presence of dams affected the propensity of macroinvertebrates to drift, and (iii) drift propensity was related to benthic periphyton biomass or natural longitudinal patterns down the river. More taxa were collected from the drift than the benthos, although drift and benthic samples were generally taxonomically similar, despite some structural differences. Nonetheless, differences were evident between the major groups when assessing density and relative abundance links between the benthos and drift. The presence of dams did not affect the propensity of macroinvertebrates to drift on the whole, nor was propensity affected by periphyton biomass or distance from source. These results suggest that although altered periphyton biomass in downstream sections in the Tongariro River is altering the composition of benthic and drifting macroinvertebrates, drift propensity is unaffected. However, some deviations from linear relationships between benthic and drift density are evident suggesting these links may be taxon specific.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell G."}],"citation-key":"tonkin13macroinvertebrate","container-title":"Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv für Hydrobiologie","container-title-short":"Fund.

  {"id":"tonkin13scale","abstract":"The effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity vary widely with the spatial scale at which they are examined. Not only do productivity and disturbance have strong influences on diversity patterns at local and regional scales but they can affect the way in which communities assemble and in turn alter beta diversity or community dissimilarity. We assessed whether the form of both the productivity- and disturbance-diversity relationships differed between the spatial scale at which they were examined using experimental stream channels in three Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand streams. In place of true local and regional richness, we used the proxies within- and between-stream richness, as well as assessing between-stream community dissimilarity (similar to beta diversity). Our results indicate that productivity and disturbance both affect diversity but at individual scales and in different forms. At the within-stream scale, richness was a u shaped function of productivity whereas at the between-stream scale richness increased monotonically with increasing productivity. Community dissimilarity on the other hand, increased monotonically with increasing rate of disturbance. Rather than a greater role of deterministic assembly with increasing disturbance, our results indicate the opposite, but it appears that communities are simply converging on those found in the surrounding streambed with time since disturbance. Specifically, communities were more similar within individual streams than within disturbance treatments and animals colonizing post-disturbance were simply a subset of taxa present at each site regardless of perceived colonizing ability, rather than a suite of specialist colonizing taxa. These results demonstrate that without a distinction between early and late colonizers, a greater rate of deterministic assembly at high disturbance will not occur.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell G."}],"citation-key":"tonkin13scale","container-title":"Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv für Hydrobiologie","container-title-short":"Fund.

  {"id":"tonkin14combined","abstract":"Damming and regulating the ﬂow of rivers is a widespread issue and can have a signiﬁcant impact on resident biota. The Tongariro River, central North Island, New Zealand, has a ﬂow regime that is regulated by two hydroelectric dams along its length, and it has been suggested that ‘ﬂushing ﬂows’ would assist benthic communities by removing ‘nuisance’ periphyton growth forms that typically occur in autumn. We assessed whether (i) damming has altered periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities downstream of the Rangipo Dam and (ii) whether the release of a ﬂow pulse equivalent to 50 times the baseﬂow is sufﬁcient to (a) move the substrate in the section of river downstream of this dam and (b) impact benthic periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities. Downstream macroinvertebrate communities were impacted by the presence of the dam, but periphyton was not. No movement of substrate occurred downstream of the dam as a result of the ﬂow release, which was likely because of naturally high embeddedness and armouring of substrate. Periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate density were not affected by the release indicating that larger releases would be required to have any effect on benthic communities downstream of this dam. This study highlights the importance of considering natural bed structure and sediment dynamics when using ﬂow releases downstream of dams to control periphyton.

  {"id":"tonkin14drivers","abstract":"Often simple metrics are used to summarise complex patterns in stream benthic ecology, thus it is important to understand how well these metrics can explain the finer-scale underlying environmental variation often hidden by coarser-scale influences. I sampled 47 relatively pristine streams in the central North Island of New Zealand in 2007 and (1) evaluated the local-scale drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure as well as both diversity and biomonitoring metrics in this unmodified landscape, and (2) assessed whether these drivers were similar for commonly used univariate metrics and multivariate structure. The drivers of community metrics and multivariate structure were largely similar, with % canopy cover and resource supply metrics the most commonly identified environmental drivers in these pristine streams. For an area with little to no anthropogenic influence, substantial variation was explained in the macroinvertebrate community (up to 70% on the first two components of a partial least squares regression), with both uni- and multivariate approaches. This research highlights two important points: (1) the importance of considering natural underlying environmental variation when assessing the response to coarse environmental gradients, and (2) the importance of considering canopy cover presence when assessing the impact of stressors on stream macroinvertebrate communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."}],"citation-key":"tonkin14drivers","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.465","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e465","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure in unmodified streams","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/465","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"tonkin14periphyton","abstract":"There is little consensus on the form of the periphyton biomass–macroinvertebrate diversity relationship in streams. One factor that these relationships do not account for is the growth form of primary producers. We (1) examined the periphyton biomass–macroinvertebrate diversity relationship in 24 streams of Cantabria, Spain, in July 2007, and (2) determined whether this relationship was underpinned, and better explained, by specific responses to the growth form of the periphyton community. We hypothesised that macroinvertebrate diversity would be a log-linear function of periphyton biomass and would respond differently to two coarse divisions of the periphytic community; i.e. positively to %cover of non-filamentous algae and negatively to %cover of streaming filamentous algae. There was no relationship between benthic periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate diversity in these streams but, as predicted, this relationship was underpinned by responses to the growth form of periphyton community. Generally, macroinvertebrate diversity responded positively to %cover of non-filaments and negatively to %cover of streaming filaments, although results were variable. These findings suggest that periphyton biomass–macroinvertebrate diversity relationships in streams can be underpinned by interactions with specific growth forms of periphyton. We suggest that further research is required to develop robust thresholds of %cover of filamentous algae cover that would benefit managers wishing to minimise negative effects of eutrophication on stream communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell G."},{"family":"Barquín","given":"José"}],"citation-key":"tonkin14periphyton","container-title":"Marine and Freshwater Research","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"tonkin14rise","abstract":"Rivers worldwide are under increasing threat from hydrologic alteration. Managing for environmental flows (E-flows) is one way of dealing with this, but research remains heavily focused on development of methods for setting flows. We examined trends in riverine flow-ecology research (the link between the flow regime and biota of a river) from 1995 to 2012 internationally by assessing publication rate of all countries combined and identifying trends in research specifically on E-flows. USA dominated the research output in flow-ecology research, but Australian researchers were the most active on E-flows. We show that E-flow research has exponentially expanded since the mid 1990s, both in number and as a percentage of general river research. Eflow research productivity also increased weakly with the number of dams and per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of countries, highlighting that this research is performed mostly in developed countries. We expect this trend will continue and suggest that E-flow research needs to be incorporated into policy in low-GDP countries to ensure healthy viable river ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Jähnig","given":"Sonja C."},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"tonkin14rise","container-title":"Environmental Processes","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"tonkin15climatic","abstract":"Little work has been done on large-scale patterns of stream insect richness in China. We explored the influence of climatic and catchment-scale factors on stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera; EPT) richness across mid-latitude China. We assessed the predictive ability of climatic, catchment land cover and physical structure variables on genus richness of EPT, both individually and combined, in 80 mid-latitude Chinese streams, spanning a 3899-m altitudinal gradient. We performed analyses using boosted regression trees and explored the nature of their influence on richness patterns. The relative importance of climate, land cover, and physical factors on stream insect richness varied considerably between the three orders, and while important for Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, latitude did not improve model fit for any of the groups. EPT richness was linked with areas comprising high forest cover, elevation and slope, large catchments and low temperatures. Ephemeroptera favoured areas with high forest cover, medium-to-large catchment sizes, high temperature seasonality, and low potential evapotranspiration. Plecoptera richness was linked with low temperature seasonality and annual mean, and high slope, elevation and warm-season rainfall. Finally, Trichoptera favoured high elevation areas, with high forest cover, and low mean annual temperature, seasonality and aridity. Our findings highlight the variable role that catchment land cover, physical properties and climatic influences have on stream insect richness. This is one of the first studies of its kind in Chinese streams, thus we set the scene for more in-depth assessments of stream insect richness across broader spatial scales in China, but stress the importance of improving data availability and consistency through time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Deep Narayan"},{"family":"Kuemmerlen","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Li","given":"Fengqing"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Jähnig","given":"Sonja C."}],"citation-key":"tonkin15climatic","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0123250","editor":[{"family":"Young","given":"Kyle A."}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e0123250","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Climatic and Catchment-Scale Predictors of Chinese Stream Insect Richness Differ between Taxonomic Groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123250","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"tonkin17seasonality","abstract":"Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-n­ ested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions. Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and applied this using global long-­term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment) spanning gradients of climatic variability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Bogan","given":"Michael T."},{"family":"Bonada","given":"Núria"},{"family":"Rios-Touma","given":"Blanca"},{"family":"Lytle","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"tonkin17seasonality","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.1761","ISSN":"00129658","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1201-1216","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Seasonality and predictability shape temporal species diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ecy.1761","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"tonkin18latitudinal","abstract":"That biodiversity declines with latitude is well known, but whether a metacommunity process is behind this gradient has received limited attention. We tested the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is progressively replaced by mass effects with increasing latitude, along with a series of related hypotheses. We explored these hypotheses by examining metacommunity structure in stream invertebrate metacommunities spanning the length of New Zealand’s two largest islands (∼1,300 km), further disentangling the role of dispersal by deconstructing assemblages into strong and weak dispersers. Given the highly dynamic nature of New Zealand streams, our alternative hypothesis was that these systems are so unpredictable (at different stages of post-ﬂood succession) that metacommunity structure is highly context dependent from region to region. We rejected our primary hypotheses, pinning this lack of ﬁt on the strong unpredictability of New Zealand’s dynamic stream ecosystems and fauna that has evolved to cope with these conditions. While local community structure turned over along this latitudinal gradient, metacommunity structure was highly context dependent and dispersal traits did not elucidate patterns. Moreover, the emergent metacommunity types exhibited no trends, nor did the important environmental variables. These results provide a cautionary tale for examining singular metacommunities. The considerable level of unexplained contingency suggests that any inferences drawn from one-off snapshot sampling may be misleading and further points to the need for more studies on temporal dynamics of metacommunity processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Death","given":"Russell G."},{"family":"Muotka","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Astorga","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Lytle","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"tonkin18latitudinal","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4898","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e4898","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do latitudinal gradients exist in New Zealand stream invertebrate metacommunities?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4898","volume":"6"},

Mechanistic multispecies models can guide decision making by evaluating trade-offs associated with flow regimes designed for specific ecosystem outcomes before implementation. We investigated the cross-ecosystem effects of environmental flow regimes designed to benefit focal groups of riparian vegetation, fishes, and invertebrates. The models revealed trade-offs among different designer flow regimes with narrow taxonomic targets, which in some cases caused non-target taxa to become locally extirpated within short (decadal) timespans. By incorporating multiple flow frequencies – from intra-annual-scale pulses to large decadal-scale floods – the simulated natural flow regime enabled balanced, albeit smaller, population sizes across the three ecosystem components: 72% of that achieved by designer flow regimes, on average. Although returning to a natural flow regime may not be possible in highly flow-modified rivers, novel flow regimes must incorporate diverse flood and drought frequencies to accommodate the occasionally conflicting requirements of different taxa at different times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Olden","given":"Julian D."},{"family":"Merritt","given":"David M."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Lindsay V."},{"family":"Rogosch","given":"Jane S."},{"family":"Lytle","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"tonkin21designing","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","DOI":"10.1002/fee.2348","ISSN":"1540-9309","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"326-333","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Designing flow regimes to support entire river ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.2348","volume":"19"},

Conclusion/Outlook: Climate change is altering river flow and thermal regimes globally, including altering the magnitude and frequency of extreme events, and this is already having a major detrimental effect on river ecosystems.

  {"id":"wetzel18unlocking","abstract":"Large quantities of biodiversity data are required to assess the current status of species, to identify drivers of population and distributional change, and to predict changes to biodiversity under future scenarios. Nevertheless, currently-available data are often not well-suited to these purposes. To highlight existing gaps, we assess the availability of species observation data in Europe, their geographic and temporal range, and their quality. We do so by reviewing the most relevant sources for European biodiversity observation data, and identifying important barriers to ﬁlling gaps. We suggest strategies, tools and frameworks to continue to ﬁll these gaps, in addition to producing data suitable for generating Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs). Our review of data sources shows that only around a third of data-providers provide unrestricted data access. Particularly large geographic gaps exist in Eastern European countries and many datasets are not suitable for generating EBVs due to the absence of long-term data. We highlight examples built on recent experiences from large data integrators, publishers and networks that help to eﬃciently improve data availability, adopt open science principles and close existing data gaps. Future strategies must urgently consider the needs of relevant data stakeholders, particularly science- and policy-related needs, and provide incentives for data-providers. Hence, sustainable, longterm infrastructures and a European biodiversity network are needed to provide such eﬃcient workﬂows, incentives for data-provision and tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wetzel","given":"Florian T."},{"family":"Bingham","given":"Heather C."},{"family":"Groom","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Haase","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kõljalg","given":"Urmas"},{"family":"Kuhlmann","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Corinne S."},{"family":"Penev","given":"Lyubomir"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Saarenmaa","given":"Hannu"},{"family":"Schmeller","given":"Dirk S."},{"family":"Stoll","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Häuser","given":"Christoph L."}],"citation-key":"wetzel18unlocking","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2017.12.024","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5]]},"language":"en","page":"78-85","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unlocking biodiversity data: Prioritization and filling the gaps in biodiversity observation data in Europe","title-short":"Unlocking biodiversity data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320717300629","volume":"221"},
  {"id":"yuan19urbanization","abstract":"Urbanization is increasing worldwide and is happening at a rapid rate in China in line with economic development. Urbanization can lead to major changes in freshwater environments through multiple chemical and microbial contaminants. We assessed the impact of urbanization on physicochemical characteristics and microbial loading in canals in Suzhou, a city that has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades. Nine sampling locations covering three urban intensity classes (high, medium and low) in Suzhou were selected for ﬁeld studies and three locations in Huangshan (natural reserve) were included as pristine control locations. Water samples were collected for physicochemical, microbiological and molecular analyses. Compared to medium and low urbanization sites, there were statistically signiﬁcant higher levels of nutrients and total and thermotolerant coliforms (or fecal coliforms) in highly urbanized locations. The eﬀect of urbanization was also apparent in the abundances of human-associated fecal markers and bacterial pathogens in water samples from highly urbanized locations. These results correlated well with land use types and anthropogenic activities at the sampling sites. The overall results indicate that urbanization negatively impacts water quality, providing high levels of nutrients and a microbial load that includes fecal markers and pathogens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Tianma"},{"family":"Vadde","given":"Kiran Kumar"},{"family":"Tonkin","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jianjun"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zimeng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yixin"},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Alan J."},{"family":"Sekar","given":"Raju"}],"citation-key":"yuan19urbanization","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph16101739","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,16]]},"language":"en","page":"1739","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urbanization Impacts the Physicochemical Characteristics and Abundance of Fecal Markers and Bacterial Pathogens in Surface Water","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/10/1739","volume":"16"}
