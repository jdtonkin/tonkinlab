## Positions 1-2: Postdoctoral Fellow and PhD student in metacommunity and evolutionary drivers of resilience

School of Biological Sciences 
University of Canterbury, New Zealand

### About the project
There is an upcoming opening for one Postdoctoral Fellow and one PhD student in the labs of Prof. Jason Tylianakis and Dr. Jonathan Tonkin at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, Aotearoa New Zealand, to work in collaboration with and funded by the Principal Investigators in Bioprotection Aotearoa Centre of Research Excellence.

### Project background
Species interactions influence how they adapt to the environment, and the interactions themselves are subject to evolutionary, coevolutionary and spatial (metacommunity) processes. While pest outbreaks are typically rare (insect herbivores are suppressed by natural enemies) climate change can alter this suppression. Moreover, the presumed long-term stability of biocontrol has been challenged by our team’s recent research that demonstrates evolution of pest resistance to enemies. As evolution against enemies can influence responses to environmental extremes, and climate can influence mechanisms of coevolution, the evolution of pest resistance to enemies will be influenced by population and community source-sink spatial processes that occur alongside environmental stressors. These positions are part of a broader project entitled “Understanding metacommunity and evolutionary drivers of resilience to pests”, in which we aim to understand how the spatial arrangement of land uses influences species interactions (focusing on biological pest management as the context), with a vision to developing guidelines for maintaining the evolutionary resilience of biological control under environmental change.

### Research aim
The aim of the **Postdoc** is to conduct theoretical work that addresses the link between ecological and (co-)evolutionary processes at local and regional scales. There will be some flexibility for the candidate to develop the specific research project, but it will likely involve the use of spatial evolving metacommunity models to understand evolutionary and ecological trade-offs between responses to the abiotic environment and interactions with enemies and resource species. 

The aim of the **PhD position** is to address the link between ecological and evolutionary processes at local and regional scales, using a model community of host insects and their parasitoids. There will be some flexibility for the candidate to develop the specific research project, but it will likely involve the use of laboratory mesocosms to manipulate dispersal, species diversity, environmental (nutrient and climate) heterogeneity and stochasticity to deconstruct how local species richness and spatial variability in community composition stabilise regional biodiversity through ecological insurance effects and spatial evolutionary dynamics. 

### Who you are
#### Postdoctoral Fellow
You must have completed a PhD in ecology, mathematics, statistics, or a related discipline. We are especially interested in candidates with a strong track record in publishing in leading ecological or interdisciplinary journals, analytical/modelling and programming skills (e.g. R or python), and a strong grounding in ecological and/or evolutionary theory. 

#### PhD student
You must have completed an undergraduate degree and Honours or Master's degree (with a significant research component) in ecology or related field. A strong background in data analysis, experience working with insects and evidence of motivation to publish would be an advantage. Once selected, the preferred candidate would then need to apply to study at The University of Canterbury and meet the institutional [criteria](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/enrol/doctoral/document-requirements/) for entry prior to the scholarship being confirmed (check whether you meet these requirements [here](https://checkwhatyouneed.canterbury.ac.nz/checkrequirements/postgraduate)).

For both positions, you must be able to be in the country and start the position no later than early 2022. If managed isolation is required (due to COVID-19) at the time of entry, the grant will cover these expenses.

### Who you will work with
Both positions will be jointly supervised by Jono Tonkin and Jason Tylianakis, and will work collaboratively with each other given the shared questions. The [Tylianakis](http://tylianakislab.org) and [Tonkin](http://tonkinlab.org) Labs both have a strong focus on understanding the impacts of environmental change on ecological communities. Our labs are diverse and interdisciplinary in thought and approach. The lab groups strive to cultivate an open, safe and supportive environment that values creativity, diversity, integrity and collaboration. We would therefore welcome applications from under-represented groups. For more information about both of our teams, please visit us our websites: http://tylianakislab.org, http://tonkinlab.org.

<!-- # Position 2: closing 20 March 2020  -->

<!-- **PhD position available in distribution modelling of Antarctic species in a warming world**   -->
<!-- School of Biological Sciences   -->
<!-- University of Canterbury, New Zealand   -->
<!-- Feb 2020   -->

<!-- The Tonkin Lab at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand is seeking outstanding applicants for one fully-funded PhD scholarship in distribution modelling of Antarctic species in a warming world. The scholarship is part of the recently-funded Antarctic Science Platform (https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz), and more specifically Project 3, which is focused on ecosystem dynamics of the Ross Sea Region. The Ross Sea Region includes some of the most pristine ecosystems on Earth. However, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are increasingly subject to the effects of climate change, which may fundamentally impact their unique ecosystems by altering the physical environment in ways that can affect species distribution, abundance, and productivity. The goal of Project 3 is to improve projections of how Ross Sea Region ecosystems will respond to anticipated change. -->

<!-- The goal for this PhD project is to develop and apply process-explicit species distribution models (e.g. including dispersal, species interactions, physiology and demography) and various other hybrid biogeographic models. The specific approach will be determined by the availability and quality of distribution data and knowledge of key biological and ecological processes. These models will be developed for a wide range of species to project the responses of Ross Sea Region ecosystems to climate change. There is flexibility regarding the specific ecological questions that can be asked within these broader aims.  -->

<!-- **Qualifications:** Undergraduate degree and Honours and/or Master's degree (with research component) in ecology or related field. Priority will be given to applicants with analytical/modelling and programming skills (e.g. R or python) and a background in ecological theory.
