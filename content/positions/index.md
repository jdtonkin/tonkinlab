# Come join us

I am always on the lookout for motivated students and postdocs with a passion for ecology and freshwater ecosystems. If you’ve had a look around our website and you’re interested in working with us, please do get in touch. Likewise, if you have an idea for a project, [get in touch](mailto:jonathan.tonkin@canterbury.ac.nz) and include a brief introduction of your experience, research interests and goals. 

# Open opportunities

Check back soon. I will be advertising 1-2 PhD projects in the next couple of weeks.
