We are always on the lookout for motivated students and postdocs to join the group. If you’ve had a look around our website and you’re interested in working with us, please do get in touch. Likewise, if you have an idea for a project, [get in touch](mailto:jonathan.tonkin@canterbury.ac.nz) and include a brief introduction of your experience, research interests and goals.

### Graduate students
Check back soon. I will be advertising 1-2 PhD projects in the next couple of weeks. 

## Other opportunities

In addition to currently-funded positions, I welcome direct applications for independently-financed projects.  

### Postdoctoral positions
We don't currently have any funded opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, but very much welcome inquiries. If you're interested in joining the group, please do get in touch with Jono with an outline of your proposed research and a CV. Funding for postdocs in New Zealand is pretty limited, so it may be best to seek funding from your home country. Jono can help put together a proposal for external funding. Any positions that do come available will be clearly advertised.

Graduate students:
We currently have no funded openings for graduate students in the group. The University of Canterbury, however, offers doctoral fellowships twice a year whose deadlines generally fall in mid-May and mid-October. If you are interested in applying for one of these scholarships, please email Daniel well in advance to express your interest and discuss the application process.




What topics could you work on?
We have a range of possible postgraduate degrees available, such as BSc Hons, MSc and PhD (details here). From time to time we have positions available on certain funded projects, but otherwise the topic you could work on is entirely up to you. It would be preferable to work on topics within our current research themes, but I am always happy to discuss different topics and whether I would be interested and capable of acting as a supervisor. Generally speaking, I am more interested in broader ecological questions than something focused on a specific taxon or region.
We conduct field work at a range of locations (normally in New Zealand, though we also have collaborative projects elsewhere), and most of the students in our group have projects that involve a field and/or lab component. However, we have others in the department that could act as co-supervisors for projects with a heavy emphasis on modeling or genetics for example. In the first instance, please contact me with an outline of the questions you would like to address. When first making contact, please also supply a CV and names (with contact details) of people who could act as potential referees. For anyone interested in graduate studies, John Thompson has some wonderful advice on his homepage.

How to get funding for studies, research, and living costs?
Research costs vary depending on the project, with some requiring little funding (e.g. for petrol to visit field sites) and others requiring more (large-scale DNA sequencing, elaborate field experiments, etc). If a postgraduate research project does not fall within a larger funded project, then it may be necessary to apply for further funding before you begin. In addition, it is not usually feasible to work in paid employment outside of the university (nor do we have enough TA work within the university to support postgraduate students), so you would need some kind of scholarship to cover your living costs for the duration of your study.
Some information on potential scholarships in biology can be found here, and it is also worth looking for funding opportunities in your home country.


Undergraduate Students
If you are a current UC Berkeley undergraduate student interested in gaining research experience, conducting a summer internship, or developing an honors thesis on freshwater ecology, please e-mail us and we will talk about ongoing projects that may be of interest. UC Berkeley undergraduates may apply to work in our group through various programs, such as URAP, SPUR, and BSP.

Graduate Students
Highly-motivated individuals wishing to join our group as a Ph.D. student are encouraged to e-mail me, including a CV and a description of background and research interests. This conversation should take place well before applying to the ESPM’s Ph.D. program, so that we can discuss fit and identify potential research projects. Many funding opportunities exist, such as NSF-GRFP, EPA-STAR, Ford Foundation, Delta Science Fellowship.




## Christchurch, New Zealand

There are not many places in the world, where you can go for a surf in the morning and follow it up for a snowboard in the afternoon. Christchurch is one of these places. If you're into the outdoors, like me, it's a bit of a wonderland. In addition to surf and snowboarding/skiing, there is world class hiking, fishing, bouldering etc. all within an hour or two drive. Thus, amazing field sites are equally accessible, including University of Canterbury's Cass Field Station and a diverse range of montane landscapes and riverscapes.
