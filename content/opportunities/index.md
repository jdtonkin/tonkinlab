We are always on the lookout for motivated students and postdocs to join the group. If you’ve had a look around our website and you’re interested in working with us, please do get in touch. Likewise, if you have an idea for a project, [get in touch](mailto:jonathan.tonkin@canterbury.ac.nz) and include a brief introduction of your experience, research interests and goals. 

## Open opportunities

### Graduate students
Check back soon. I will be advertising 1-2 PhD projects in the next couple of weeks. 

## Other opportunities

In addition to currently-funded positions, I welcome direct applications for independently-financed projects.

Postdoctoral fellows:
We currently have no funded openings for postdoctoral fellows but are always open to intriguing possibilities. If you are interested in beginning discussions of options for pursuing external funding (e.g., Marie Curie Outgoing Fellowships, NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowships, or Beques BP-A), please email Daniel with a list of research interests and a copy of your CV.


Anybody interested in carrying out postdoctoral research in our group should contact Jason Tylianakis in the first instance with an outline of their proposed research topic. I am happy to consider any potential idea that falls within my general expertise. Postdoctoral funding in New Zealand is very difficult to obtain, so it is necessary in most cases to secure funding from the researcher's home country. If we have any funded positions available, these will be advertised on the homepage of this website.



Graduate students:
We currently have no funded openings for graduate students in the group. The University of Canterbury, however, offers doctoral fellowships twice a year whose deadlines generally fall in mid-May and mid-October. If you are interested in applying for one of these scholarships, please email Daniel well in advance to express your interest and discuss the application process.




What topics could you work on?
We have a range of possible postgraduate degrees available, such as BSc Hons, MSc and PhD (details here). From time to time we have positions available on certain funded projects, but otherwise the topic you could work on is entirely up to you. It would be preferable to work on topics within our current research themes, but I am always happy to discuss different topics and whether I would be interested and capable of acting as a supervisor. Generally speaking, I am more interested in broader ecological questions than something focused on a specific taxon or region.
We conduct field work at a range of locations (normally in New Zealand, though we also have collaborative projects elsewhere), and most of the students in our group have projects that involve a field and/or lab component. However, we have others in the department that could act as co-supervisors for projects with a heavy emphasis on modeling or genetics for example. In the first instance, please contact me with an outline of the questions you would like to address. When first making contact, please also supply a CV and names (with contact details) of people who could act as potential referees. For anyone interested in graduate studies, John Thompson has some wonderful advice on his homepage.

How to get funding for studies, research, and living costs?
Research costs vary depending on the project, with some requiring little funding (e.g. for petrol to visit field sites) and others requiring more (large-scale DNA sequencing, elaborate field experiments, etc). If a postgraduate research project does not fall within a larger funded project, then it may be necessary to apply for further funding before you begin. In addition, it is not usually feasible to work in paid employment outside of the university (nor do we have enough TA work within the university to support postgraduate students), so you would need some kind of scholarship to cover your living costs for the duration of your study.
Some information on potential scholarships in biology can be found here, and it is also worth looking for funding opportunities in your home country.




## Christchurch, New Zealand

There are not many places in the world, where you can go for a surf in the morning and follow it up for a snowboard in the afternoon. Christchurch is one of these places. If you're into the outdoors, like me, it's a bit of a wonderland. In addition to surf and snowboarding/skiing, there is world class hiking, fishing, bouldering etc. all within an hour or two drive. Thus, amazing field sites are equally accessible, including University of Canterbury's Cass Field Station and a diverse range of montane landscapes and riverscapes.
