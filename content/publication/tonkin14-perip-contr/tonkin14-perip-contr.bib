 abstract = {There is little consensus on the form of the
periphyton biomass-macroinvertebrate diversity
relationship in streams. One factor that these
relationships do not account for is the growth form
of primary producers. We (1) examined the periphyton
biomass-macroinvertebrate diversity relationship in
24 streams of Cantabria, Spain, in July 2007, and
(2) determined whether this relationship was
underpinned, and better explained, by specific
responses to the growth form of the periphyton
community. We hypothesised that macroinvertebrate
diversity would be a log-linear function of
periphyton biomass and would respond differently to
two coarse divisions of the periphytic community;
i.e. positively to %cover of non-filamentous algae
and negatively to %cover of streaming filamentous
algae. There was no relationship between benthic
periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate diversity
in these streams but, as predicted, this
relationship was underpinned by responses to the
growth form of periphyton community. Generally,
macroinvertebrate diversity responded positively to
%cover of non-filaments and negatively to %cover
of streaming filaments, although results were
variable. These findings suggest that periphyton
biomass-macroinvertebrate diversity relationships in
streams can be underpinned by interactions with
specific growth forms of periphyton. We suggest that
further research is required to develop robust
thresholds of %cover of filamentous algae cover
that would benefit managers wishing to minimise
negative effects of eutrophication on stream
communities.},
