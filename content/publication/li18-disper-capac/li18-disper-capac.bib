 abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental trait influencing
speciesÂ´ distribution patterns and metacommunity
structure. Yet, for stream communities it remains
unclear how communities differ in dispersal
capacity. Due to the dendritic network structure of
streams and the greater spatial variability in
environmental conditions in headwaters than in
mainstems, we asked three main questions: 1) Do
benthic invertebrates inhabiting headwaters have
lower community-wide dispersal capacities (DCc) on
average than those living in mainstems? 2) In turn,
does the degree of community dissimilarity among
sites differ between the different locations in the
river network? 3) Are these differences more
pronounced in highland streams compared to lowland
streams as a consequence of major landscape features
(i.e. mountains)? To examine these questions, we
compiled 1466 benthic invertebrate samples across
the southern highland and northern lowland areas of
Germany. Results showed that overall DCc increased
with stream size in both highland and lowland
streams. In highland streams, higher DCc in
mainstems was associated with more homogeneous
communities compared to headwater
communities. However, this pattern did not occur in
lowland streams. This suggests that both dispersal
capacity and landscape structure interact to
determine community structure in these networks. Our
results therefore stress the importance of
considering dispersal traits and landscape features,
as well as habitat control (or environmental
filtering) to better understand (meta-) community
structure across various landscape types.},
