 abstract = {Exploring and describing biodiversity and the
mechanisms structuring it is fundamental to
advancing ecology. This is particularly pertinent in
understudied biogeographical regions, such as the
Afrotropics, that are characterised by strong
seasonal climatic shifts. We investigated the
characteristics of stream biodiversity in the Niger
Delta region of Nigeria, a tropical biodiversity
hotspot, by examining patterns in 20 stream
invertebrate communities across both the wet and dry
seasons. For this, we took a multi-faceted approach
accounting for the three levels of biodiversity
($α$, $β$ and $γ$), including
partitioning the nestedness and turnover components
of $β$ diversity, regional occupancy-abundance
patterns, niche characteristics, and the
environmental drivers of community
structure. $α$ diversity was low in these
streams, with strong turnover between sites leading
to high $β$ diversity contributing to regional
biodiversity, but there was little variation in
communities between seasons. The proportion of sites
occupied by taxa declined with increasing niche
position, and decreasing niche breadth. Occupancy
was predicted well by a combination of these two
factors (niche position and breadth), but not mean
local abundance, as the abundance-occupancy link was
an upper-limit unimodal relationship. On average,
community structure was linked more strongly to
environmental variables in the wet season. Our
findings demonstrate the clear role of spatial, but
not temporal, turnover in assemblages, which likely
reflects the environmental heterogeneity of this
region. This is further supported by the fact that
regional occupancy was mostly related to niche
characteristics, particularly niche position. We
emphasise the importance of continued basic and
applied ecological work in this important
biogeographic region to enable better protection of
its biodiversity.},
