 abstract = {Resilience in river ecosystems requires that
organisms must persist in the face of highly dynamic
hydrological and geomorphological
variations. Disturbance events such as floods and
droughts are postulated to shape life history traits
that support resilience, but river management and
conservation would benefit from greater
understanding of the emergent effects in communities
of river organisms. We unify current knowledge of
taxonomic-, phylogenetic-, and trait-based aspects
of river communities that might aid the
identification and quantification of resilience
mechanisms. Temporal variations in river
productivity, physical connectivity, and
environmental heterogeneity resulting from floods
and droughts are highlighted as key characteristics
that promote resilience in these dynamic
ecosystems. Three community-wide mechanisms that
underlie resilience are (a) partitioning
(competition/facilitation) of dynamically varying
resources, (b) dispersal, recolonization, and
recruitment promoted by connectivity, and (c)
functional redundancy in communities promoted by
resource heterogeneity and refugia. Along with
taxonomic and phylogenetic identity, biological
traits related to feeding specialization, dispersal
ability, and habitat specialization mediate organism
responses to disturbance. Measures of these factors
might also enable assessment of the relative
contributions of different mechanisms to community
resilience. Interactions between abiotic drivers and
biotic aspects of resource use, dispersal, and
persistence have clear implications for river
conservation and management. To support these
management needs, we propose a set of taxonomic,
phylogenetic, and life-history trait metrics that
might be used to measure resilience mechanisms. By
identifying such indicators, our proposed framework
can enable targeted management strategies to adapt
river ecosystems to global change.},
