 abstract = {From laboratory studies, the relationship between
the oligochaete Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei (CL)
and its freshwater snail hosts is known to be
context-dependent, ranging from mutualistic to
parasitic. We monitored snail communities of seven
streams in Germany during three seasons of a year
and investigated infestation by CL. Some snail
species never were infested. In snail species that
were infested, size, substratum type, oxygen
concentration and species identity were the most
important variables explaining the variance in CL
infestation. Independent of individual snail size,
Bithynia tentaculata, Ancylus fluviatilis and
Acroloxus lacustris showed the highest CL
abundances. Across species, CL abundances were
highest in large individuals on silty substratum at
well-oxygenated sites. Reproductive success of snail
populations was estimated from proportion of
juveniles in populations. This measure of
reproductive success of snail populations was
inversely related with CL infestation level. These
results suggest that CL infestation affects aquatic
snails at the population and community level in the
field. Differential infestation levels and different
impacts of CL infestation between species lead to an
asymmetric distribution of positive and negative
effects among all snail species present in a
habitat. Thus, CL may be an overlooked agent in
structuring snail communities.},
