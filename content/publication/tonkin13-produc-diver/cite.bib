 abstract = {More productive environments typically have more
species, although the specific form of this
relationship is unclear and can vary with spatial
scale. This relationship has received little direct
attention in lotic systems, and thus the nature of
the relationship is unclear, as is any effect of
spatial scale. We examined the link between stream
primary productivity and macroinvertebrate diversity
in Spain and New Zealand and hypothesized that
macroinvertebrate diversity would increase
log-linearly with increasing productivity in both
regions. We sampled 24 streams in Cantabria, Spain,
and 24 in the central North Island, New
Zealand. Algal primary productivity was
approximately three times higher in Spanish streams,
but taxonomic richness of invertebrates did not
differ between the regions. Richness and Shannon
diversity only responded to productivity in the New
Zealand streams, exhibiting the predicted log-linear
increase. In the Spanish streams, only the total
number of individuals increased with
productivity. However, when plotted on the same
axes, richness in the Spanish streams simply
occurred on the linear portion of the graph to the
right of the New Zealand streams. We speculate that
productivity in the Spanish streams never became low
enough to constrain diversity, but did in the New
Zealand streams. Combining results from the two
regions, there is no evidence of a decline in
diversity with higher productivity.},
