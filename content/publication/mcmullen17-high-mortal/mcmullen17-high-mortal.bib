 abstract = {Disturbances cause high mortality in populations
while simultaneously enhancing population growth by
improving habitats. These countervailing effects
make it difficult to predict population dynamics
following disturbance events. To address this
challenge, we derived a novel form of the logistic
growth equation that permits time-varying carrying
capacity and growth rate. We combined this equation
with concepts drawn from disturbance ecology to
create a general model for population dynamics in
disturbance-prone systems. A river flooding example
using three insect species (a fast life-cycle
mayfly, a slow life-cycle dragonfly and an ostracod)
found optimal tradeoffs between disturbance
frequency vs. magnitude and a close fit to empirical
data in 62% of cases. A savanna fire
analysis identified fire frequencies of 3-4 years
that maximised population size of a perennial
grass. The model shows promise for predicting
population dynamics after multiple disturbance
events and for management of river flows and fire
regimes.},
