 abstract = {The ground weta (Hemiandrus maculifrons) is an
apparently abundant species with a New Zealand-wide
distribution. Despite this, there is a paucity of
ecological and biological information concerning
this species. We aimed to gain new information about
movement patterns, capture rates and body size
differences by tagging individuals and conducting
nightly surveys of a single H. maculifrons
population in the Otanewainuku Forest, Bay of
Plenty, New Zealand. Over a 26-night period between
March and April 2012, we tagged 53 females and 78
males with queen bee tags and small reflector strips
and recorded the location of animals that were
subsequently re-sighted. Adult females were
significantly larger than males, but capture and
re-sight rates suggested males were the more
abundant sex during the study period. Female weta
moved further over consecutive nights than males
(average distance moved, 1.57 m vs. 1.01 m,
respectively); however, the tagging method, time of
year and study area may have resulted in
underestimates. These results indicate areas for
further research into aspects of sexual selection,
such as potentially biased sex ratios, sexual size
dimorphism and mate competition, within
H. maculifrons.},
