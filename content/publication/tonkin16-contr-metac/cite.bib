 abstract = {Habitat connectivity and dispersal interact to
structure metacommunities, but few studies have
examined these patterns jointly for organisms across
the aquatic-terrestrial ecotone. We assessed
metacommunity structure and beta diversity patterns
of instream benthic invertebrates, riparian carabid
beetles (Order: Coleoptera; Family: Carabidae) and
riparian spiders (Order: Araneae) at fifteen sites
in a river-floodplain system. Sampling took place
over a three-year period (2010-2012) in the
Rhine-Main-Observatory LTER site on the Kinzig
River, central Germany. This allowed disentangling
the combined influence, and temporal variability, of
habitat connectivity (i.e. between aquatic and
terrestrial) and dispersal ability (i.e. between
spiders and beetles, and aerial and aquatic
dispersing invertebrates) on the dominant paradigms
structuring these metacommunities. We found mostly
consistent differences in the manner that
metacommunities were structured between groups, with
lower levels of variability explained for beetles
compared to the other groups. Beetles were
consistently structured more by turnover than
nestedness components, with greater beta diversity
than expected by chance and a minor spatial compared
to environmental signal emerging with variance
partitioning. Conversely, spiders and benthic
invertebrates had lower beta diversity and greater
nestedness than null expectation, and a clearer
spatial signal controlling metacommunity
structure. Our results suggest varying levels of
mass effects and species sorting shape
river-floodplain metacommunities, depending on
habitat connectivity and dispersal ability. That is,
greater connectivity and lower fragmentation along
the river compared to the terrestrial zone promoted
mass effects, and differences in overall dispersal
ability and mode (i.e. active and passive) for
instream and riparian communities shifted paradigms
between mass effects and species sorting.},
