 abstract = {Large quantities of biodiversity data are required
to assess the current status of species, to identify
drivers of population and distributional change, and
to predict changes to biodiversity under future
scenarios. Nevertheless, currently-available data
are often not well-suited to these purposes. To
highlight existing gaps, we assess the availability
of species observation data in Europe, their
geographic and temporal range, and their quality. We
do so by reviewing the most relevant sources for
European biodiversity observation data, and
identifying important barriers to filling gaps. We
suggest strategies, tools and frameworks to continue
to fill these gaps, in addition to producing data
suitable for generating Essential Biodiversity
Variables (EBVs). Our review of data sources shows
that only around a third of data-providers provide
unrestricted data access. Particularly large
geographic gaps exist in Eastern European countries
and many datasets are not suitable for generating
EBVs due to the absence of long-term data. We
highlight examples built on recent experiences from
large data integrators, publishers and networks that
help to efficiently improve data availability, adopt
open science principles and close existing data
gaps. Future strategies must urgently consider the
needs of relevant data stakeholders, particularly
science- and policy-related needs, and provide
incentives for data-providers. Hence, sustainable,
long-term infrastructures and a European
biodiversity network are needed to provide such
efficient workflows, incentives for data-provision
and tools.},
