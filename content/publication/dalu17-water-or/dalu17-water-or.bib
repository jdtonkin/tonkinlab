 abstract = {Water pollution is a critical management issue, with
many rivers and streams draining urban areas being
polluted by the disposal of untreated solid waste
and wastewater discharge, storm water and
agricultural runoff. This has implications for
biodiversity, and many rivers in the developing
world are now considered compromised. We
investigated benthic macroinvertebrate community
structure and composition in relation to
physico-chemical conditions of the water column and
sediments. The study was conducted in an Austral
catchment subject to both urban and agricultural
pollutants in two different seasons. We assessed
whether sediment characteristics were more important
drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition
than water column characteristics. We expected clear
differences in macroinvertebrate community
composition and in the associated community metrics
due to distinct flow conditions between the two
seasons. A combination of multivariate analyses
(canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)) and
biological indicator analysis were used to examine
these patterns. Chironomidae was the most abundant
family (> 60 \ \ \ %) in the upper mainstem river
and stream sites. Stream sites were positively
associated with CCA axis 2, being characterised by
high turbidity and lower pH, salinity, phosphate
concentration, channel width and canopy
cover. Canopy cover, channel width, substrate
embeddedness, phosphate concentration, pH, salinity
and turbidity all had a significant effect on
macroinvertebrate community composition. Using CCA
variation partitioning, water quality was, however,
a better predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate
composition than sediment chemical
conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that
seasonality had little effect on structuring benthic
macroinvertebrate communities in this south-eastern
zone of South Africa, despite clear changes in
sediment chemistry. This likely reflects the
relative lack of major variability in water
chemistry compared to sediment chemistry between
seasons and the relatively muted variability in
precipitation between seasons than the more classic
Austral temperate climates.},
