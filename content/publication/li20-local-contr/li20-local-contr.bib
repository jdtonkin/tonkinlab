 abstract = {It is increasingly well understood that stream
communities are regulated by both local niche and
regional dispersal processes, but comprehensive
tests of these factors with datasets that cover
extensive spatial and temporal scales are
rare. Based on 1180 benthic invertebrate community
samples from 2005 to 2012 in central low mountain
streams of Germany, we tested the hypotheses that:
1) local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD: a
measure of the uniqueness of communities) would
decline with increasing average community dispersal
capacity; and 2) owing to the relatively large
spatial extent of the study region, regional
dispersal processes would override local niche
controls in structuring community composition. We
found considerable temporal variation in LCBD and a
negative correlation between LCBD and community
dispersal capacity. However, no statistically
significant correlation between species contribution
to beta diversity (SCBD) and species dispersal
capacity was observed. The large-scale spatial
structure among locations (representative of
dispersal limitation) was important in structuring
benthic communities. Although much of the variation
was explained by the shared effects of local
processes and large-scale spatial variables,
environmental controls were stronger than regional
processes in few cases in the variance partitioning
analysis, with the annual mean temperature and mean
diurnal range of temperature being the important
drivers. Given the highly varied correlates of beta
diversity over time, we urge researchers to focus on
not only spatial variation in diversity, but also
the context of temporal variation.},
