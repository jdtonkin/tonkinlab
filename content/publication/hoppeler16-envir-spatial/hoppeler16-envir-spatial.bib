 abstract = {Ecological studies of freshwater biota in
understudied regions are often obstructed by poor
taxonomic knowledge. We posit that molecular tools
can help alleviate this issue and present an example
where we combined molecular tools, environmental
data and ecological statistics to investigate the
distribution and community ecology of an unknown
fauna of hydropsychid caddisflies along altitudinal
gradients in four Himalayan river systems of Central
and Eastern Nepal. A total of 484 larval specimens
from 34 tributaries were examined. Phylogenetic
analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I
(COI) and the nuclear ribosomal RNA 28S were used to
delineate molecular operational taxonomic units
(MOTUs) applying three analytical methods: general
mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model, Automatic
Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) and Bayesian
Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP). Spatial
distributional patterns and potential differences in
ecological niches among MOTUs were statistically
tested using regression and correlation
approaches. Further, we examined the data for signs
of non-random structure in MOTU communities. MOTU
diversity within the family of Hydropsychidae was
generally high but varied across evaluated gene
fragments and slightly among delineation
methods. Yet, the subsequent evaluation of
environmental and spatial drivers and resulting
distributional patterns were highly consistent among
the different MOTU estimates. Within each river
system, we found community composition varied
greatly along the altitudinal gradients, with many
MOTUs associated with specific altitudinal
ranges. Prevalent MOTU turnover at the river system
scale indicated high $β$-diversity in the
hydropsychid community leading to high degrees of
regional endemism. In the Langtang river system, we
found fewer MOTU co-occurrences than expected by
chance. These results highlight the utility of
DNA-based approaches using variable genetic markers
(mitochondrial or ribosomal nuclear) for primary
biodiversity assessment of poorly studied groups or
regions. Our study further shows that DNA-based
biodiversity measures are suitable for downstream
applications, such as exploring fundamental
questions in stream ecology.},
