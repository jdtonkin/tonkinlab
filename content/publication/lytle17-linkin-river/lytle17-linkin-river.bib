 abstract = {Modeling riparian plant dynamics along rivers is
complicated by the fact that plants have different
edaphic and hydrologic requirements at different
life stages. With intensifying human demands for
water and continued human alteration of rivers,
there is a growing need for predicting responses of
vegetation to flow alteration, including responses
related to climate change and river flow
management. We developed a coupled structured
population model that combines stage-specific
responses of plant guilds with specific attributes
of river hydrologic regime. The model uses
information on the vital rates of guilds as they
relate to different hydrologic conditions (flood,
drought, and baseflow), but deliberately omits
biotic interactions from the structure (interaction
neutral). Our intent was to (1) consolidate key
vital rates concerning plant population dynamics and
to incorporate these data into a quantitative
framework, (2) determine whether complex plant stand
dynamics, including biotic interactions, can be
predicted from basic vital rates and river
hydrology, and (3) project how altered flow regimes
might affect riparian communities. We illustrated
the approach using five flow-response guilds that
encompass much of the river floodplain community:
hydroriparian tree, xeroriparian shrub,
hydroriparian shrub, mesoriparian meadow, and desert
shrub. We also developed novel network-based tools
for predicting community-wide effects of
climate-driven shifts and deliberately altered flow
regimes. The model recovered known patterns of
hydroriparian tree vs. xeroriparian shrub dominance,
including the relative proportion of these two
guilds as a function of river flow modification. By
simulating flow alteration scenarios ranging from
increased drought to shifts in flood timing, the
model predicted that mature hydroriparian forest
should be most abundant near the observed natural
flow regime. Multiguild sensitivity analysis
identified substantial network connectivity (many
connected nodes) and biotic linkage (strong pairwise
connections between nodes) under natural flow regime
conditions. Both connectivity and linkage were
substantially reduced under drought and other
flow-alteration scenarios, suggesting that community
structure is destabilized under such
conditions. This structured population modeling
approach provides a useful tool for understanding
the community-wide effects of altered flow regimes
due to climate change and management actions that
influence river flow regime.},
