 abstract = {Macroinvertebrate drift was sampled at 15 sites
along the Tongariro River, New Zealand above and
below two hydroelectric dams. Sixty-seven
invertebrate taxa were collected in the
drift. Trichoptera (31) were the most diverse,
followed by Diptera (13), Ephemeroptera (8) and
Plecoptera (8). However, chironomidae were the
numerically dominant taxa in the drift throughout
the river and represented over 80 % of all
animals collected. Of these, Orthocladiinae and
Diamesinae were the most abundant. Taxonomic
richness declined with distance downstream and
peaked at sites with intermediate levels of
periphyton biomass. The per cent of Ephemeroptera,
Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) was 3-4 times
higher in the unregulated section of the river and
declined exponentially with both distance downstream
and increase in periphyton biomass, but densities
were similar along the river. Of the measured
environmental variables periphyton biomass was most
closely linked with drift community
structure. Periphyton biomass was six times higher
in the lower section of the river than the upper
unregulated section. The autocorrelation between
periphyton biomass and distance downstream
complicates the interpretation of results. However,
because of the distinct differences between above
and below dam sections of river in periphyton
biomass and the strong link between it and
invertebrate drift we suggest that the alteration of
flow patterns by the hydroelectric dams and the
associated shift in periphyton biomass is the most
likely explanation for invertebrate drift patterns
in the river.},
