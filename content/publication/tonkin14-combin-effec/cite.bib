 abstract = {Damming and regulating the flow of rivers is a
widespread issue and can have a significant impact
on resident biota. The Tongariro River, central
North Island, New Zealand, has a flow regime that is
regulated by two hydroelectric dams along its
length, and it has been suggested that 'flushing
flows' would assist benthic communities by removing
'nuisance' periphyton growth forms that typically
occur in autumn. We assessed whether (i) damming has
altered periphyton and macroinvertebrate communities
downstream of the Rangipo Dam and (ii) whether the
release of a flow pulse equivalent to 50 times the
baseflow is sufficient to (a) move the substrate in
the section of river downstream of this dam and (b)
impact benthic periphyton and macroinvertebrate
communities. Downstream macroinvertebrate
communities were impacted by the presence of the
dam, but periphyton was not. No movement of
substrate occurred downstream of the dam as a result
of the flow release, which was likely because of
naturally high embeddedness and armouring of
substrate. Periphyton biomass and macroinvertebrate
density were not affected by the release indicating
that larger releases would be required to have any
effect on benthic communities downstream of this
dam. This study highlights the importance of
considering natural bed structure and sediment
dynamics when using flow releases downstream of dams
to control periphyton.},
