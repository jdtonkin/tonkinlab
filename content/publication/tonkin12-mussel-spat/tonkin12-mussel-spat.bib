 abstract = {The application of mussel spat rope for enabling the
passage of redfin bully Gobiomorphus huttoni through
culverts, which create velocity barriers, was
trialled in the laboratory. No fish were able to
access the un-roped control pipes whereas 52 %
successfully negotiated the pipes in the rope
treatments. The success of fish ascending treatment
pipes suggests mussel spat rope may be effective for
enabling the passage of this and other similar fish
species through otherwise impassable culverts with
velocity barriers.},
