 abstract = {Species' ranges along altitudinal clines are
probably influenced by their ability to adapt to a
range of abiotic factors. Physical adaptations in
response to lower temperatures at higher altitudes
often include changes in body size. We investigated
the distribution and potential change in body size
with altitude of two species of ground wētā,
Hemiandrus maculifrons and Hemiandrus pallitarsis in
the Moehau Ecological Area on the Coromandel
Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand. Over eight
nights of searching, 17 adult H. maculifrons and 28
adult H. pallitarsis were found. Hemiandrus
maculifrons was the smaller of the two species and
was found at higher altitudes compared with
H. pallitarsis (91-577 m and 27-207 m,
respectively). No ground wētā were caught in baited
and unbaited live-catch pitfall traps (40 set at
211-242 m above sea level; 40 at 620-626 m above sea
level). Despite what appeared to be a tendency for
the size of male H. maculifrons to increase with
altitude, we found no evidence of intraspecific
variation in body size with altitude although sample
sizes were small. Nevertheless, these two species of
ground wētā appear well suited to further
investigations into aspects associated with factors
that influence body size, distributional range
shifts and climate change.},
