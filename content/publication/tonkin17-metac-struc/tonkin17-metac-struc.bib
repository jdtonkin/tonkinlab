 abstract = {Aim: To examine metacommunity structuring in stream
communities over large elevational gradients by
disentangling physical and environmental structuring
and the importance of different dispersal routes and
niche characteristics. Location: Headwater streams
in three catchments in the Hindu-Kush Himalaya of
central and eastern Nepal. Methods: We explored
metacommunity structuring of stream invertebrates
(including deconstructed assemblages by niche
position and breadth) using a combination of
approaches, including the elements of metacommunity
structure and distance-decay relationships. We
compared the importance of dispersal routes,
elevation and local environmental conditions through
five distance matrices: Euclidean, topographic,
river network, elevational and
environmental. Results: Communities were structured
along the elevational gradient with clear turnover
apparent in two catchments, with Clementsian
(compartmentalized) and Gleasonian (individualistic)
distributions. Local environment played a minor
role, and the selected distance matrices
(i.e. elevation, three physical distances and
environment) varied between catchments and niche
groups. Contrary to expectation, specialists were
more spatially than environmentally controlled,
potentially reflecting dispersal limitation. Main
conclusions: In these physically dominated systems,
local environment was overridden by dispersal
limitation, particularly when considering
specialists. Where barriers were not limiting
dispersal, niche sorting along the elevational
gradients represented the key structuring
force. Overall, our findings reveal the importance
of elevation and the spatial arrangement of sites in
structuring metacommunities. We emphasize the value
of considering physical structuring and spatial
extent in modulating species sorting in
metacommunities.},
