 abstract = {Organisms often respond in similar ways to
environmental or spatial gradients, particularly at
large spatial scales. Yet, while understanding these
relationships is important for both basic and
applied purposes, such as identifying surrogate taxa
for conservation and monitoring purposes, patterns
at finer scales and across ecotones are less
certain. Our central aim was to explore patterns in
community concordance at the river-riparian
interface and examine whether concordance was
decoupled by increasing anthropogenic stress (a
gradient of local land-use intensity). We explored
this at 15 sites over three years within the LTER
site, Rhine-Main-Observatory, a low mountain river
system in central Germany, assessing concordance
between four organism groups: riparian spiders and
carabid beetles, benthic macroinvertebrates, and
combined aquatic macrophytes and riparian
plants. This represented three different linkages:
(1) predator-prey, (2) direct competition, and (3)
habitat associations. While there were no
correlations in richness patterns, multivariate
community structure was highly concordant between
all groups. Anthropogenic stress strongly reduced
links between riparian spiders and carabid beetles,
likely resulting from their shared resource
requirements. However, increasing concordance
generally occurred between plants and other groups,
although inconsistently between the three groups. We
posit that patterns may be resulting from two
processes: (1) linkages between directly competing
species decouple with increasing anthropogenic
stress, and (2) stronger coupling may occur between
habitat providers and dependent species when overall
habitat complexity is reduced. Our results highlight
the complex manner in which anthropogenic stress can
influence ecosystem structure, particularly at small
scales. Based on these complexities, we recommend
considering the full suite of community data to
adequately explore biodiversity patterns or when
searching for surrogate taxa.},
