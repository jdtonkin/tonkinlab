 abstract = {Little work has been done on large-scale patterns of
stream insect richness in China. We explored the
influence of climatic and catchment-scale factors on
stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera,
Trichoptera; EPT) richness across mid-latitude
China. We assessed the predictive ability of
climatic, catchment land cover and physical
structure variables on genus richness of EPT, both
individually and combined, in 80 mid-latitude
Chinese streams, spanning a 3899-m altitudinal
gradient. We performed analyses using boosted
regression trees and explored the nature of their
influence on richness patterns. The relative
importance of climate, land cover, and physical
factors on stream insect richness varied
considerably between the three orders, and while
important for Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, latitude
did not improve model fit for any of the groups. EPT
richness was linked with areas comprising high
forest cover, elevation and slope, large catchments
and low temperatures. Ephemeroptera favoured areas
with high forest cover, medium-to-large catchment
sizes, high temperature seasonality, and low
potential evapotranspiration. Plecoptera richness
was linked with low temperature seasonality and
annual mean, and high slope, elevation and
warm-season rainfall. Finally, Trichoptera favoured
high elevation areas, with high forest cover, and
low mean annual temperature, seasonality and
aridity. Our findings highlight the variable role
that catchment land cover, physical properties and
climatic influences have on stream insect
richness. This is one of the first studies of its
kind in Chinese streams, thus we set the scene for
more in-depth assessments of stream insect richness
across broader spatial scales in China, but stress
the importance of improving data availability and
consistency through time.},
