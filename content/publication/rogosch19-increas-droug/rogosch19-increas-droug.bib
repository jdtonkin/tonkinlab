 abstract = {Understanding how novel biological assemblages are
structured in relation to dynamic environmental
regimes remains a central challenge in
ecology. Demographic approaches to modeling species
assemblages show promise because they seek to
represent fundamental relationships between
population dynamics and environmental conditions. In
dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions
have shifted drought and flooding regimes with
implications for fish communities. Our goals were to
(1) develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic
model that links native and nonnative species with
river flow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic
responses in population and community structure to
changing flow regimes. Each fish species was
represented by a stage-structured matrix, and
species were coupled together into a multispecies
framework through density-dependent relationships in
reproduction. Then, community dynamics were
simulated through time using annual flow events
classified from gaged streamflow data. We
parameterized the model with vital rates and
flow-response relationships for a community of
native and nonnative fishes using literature-derived
values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde
River (Arizona, USA), a major tributary within the
Colorado River Basin, for the past half century
(1964-2017). Model validation revealed a match
between model projections and relative abundance
trends observed in a long-term fish monitoring
dataset (1994-2008). At the beginning of the
validation period (1994), model and survey
observations showed that native species comprised
approximately 80 \ \ \ % of total abundance. Model
projections beyond the survey data (2008-2017)
predicted a shift from a native dominant to a
nonnative dominant assemblage, coinciding with
increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between
native and nonnative species dominance emerged from
differences in mortality in response to the changing
sequence of major flow events including spring
floods, summer high flows, and droughts. In
conclusion, the demographic approach presented here
provides a flexible modeling framework that is
readily applied to other stream systems and species
by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate,
species vital rates and flow-event thresholds.},
