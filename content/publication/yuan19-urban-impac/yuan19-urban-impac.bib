 abstract = {Urbanization is increasing worldwide and is
happening at a rapid rate in China in line with
economic development. Urbanization can lead to major
changes in freshwater environments through multiple
chemical and microbial contaminants. We assessed the
impact of urbanization on physicochemical
characteristics and microbial loading in canals in
Suzhou, a city that has experienced rapid
urbanization in recent decades. Nine sampling
locations covering three urban intensity classes
(high, medium and low) in Suzhou were selected for
field studies and three locations in Huangshan
(natural reserve) were included as pristine control
locations. Water samples were collected for
physicochemical, microbiological and molecular
analyses. Compared to medium and low urbanization
sites, there were statistically significant higher
levels of nutrients and total and thermotolerant
coliforms (or fecal coliforms) in highly urbanized
locations. The effect of urbanization was also
apparent in the abundances of human-associated fecal
markers and bacterial pathogens in water samples
from highly urbanized locations. These results
correlated well with land use types and
anthropogenic activities at the sampling sites. The
overall results indicate that urbanization
negatively impacts water quality, providing high
levels of nutrients and a microbial load that
includes fecal markers and pathogens.},
