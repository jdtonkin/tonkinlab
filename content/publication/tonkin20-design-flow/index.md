abstract: 'Overcoming challenges of water scarcity necessitates creative flow management
  approaches that account for multiple, potentially competing water needs of plants
  and animals in river ecosystems. Mechanistic multispecies models can guide decision
  making by evaluating trade-offs associated with flow regimes designed for specific
  ecosystem outcomes before implementation. We investigated the cross-ecosystem effects
  of environmental flow regimes designed to benefit focal groups of riparian vegetation,
  fishes, and invertebrates. The models revealed trade-offs among different designer
  flow regimes with narrow taxonomic targets, which in some cases caused non-target
  taxa to become locally extirpated within short (decadal) timespans. By incorporating
  multiple flow frequencies – from intra-annual-scale pulses to large decadal-scale
  floods – the simulated natural flow regime enabled balanced, albeit smaller, population
  sizes across the three ecosystem components: 72% of that achieved by designer flow
  regimes, on average. Although returning to a natural flow regime may not be possible
  in highly flow-modified rivers, novel flow regimes must incorporate diverse flood
  and drought frequencies to accommodate the occasionally conflicting requirements
  of different taxa at different times.'

We found tradeoffs among different regimes with narrow targets, including causing non‐target taxa to become locally extirpated within decadal timespans.'
