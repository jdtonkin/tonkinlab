 abstract = {Riverine ecosystems are governed by patterns of
temporal variation in river flows. This dynamism
will change due to climate change and the
near-ubiquitous human control of river flows
globally, which may have severe effects on species
distributions and interactions. We employed a
combination of population modelling and network
theory to explore the consequences of possible flow
regime futures on riparian plant communities,
including scenarios of increased drought, flooding
and flow homogenization (removal of flow
variability). We found that even slight
modifications to the historic natural flow regime
had significant consequences for the structure of
riparian plant networks. Networks of emergent
interactions between plant guilds were most
connected at the natural flow regime and became
simplified with increasing flow alteration. The most
influential component of flow alteration was flood
reduction, with drought and flow homogenization both
having greater simplifying community-wide
consequences than increased flooding. These findings
suggest that maintaining floods under future
climates will be needed to overcome the negative
long-term consequences of flow modification on
riverine ecosystems.},
