 abstract = {Understanding restoration effectiveness is often
impaired by a lack of high-quality, long-term
monitoring data and, to date, few researchers have
used species' trait information to gain insight into
the processes that drive the reaction of fish
communities to restoration. We examined
fish-community responses with a highly resolved data
set from 21 consecutive years of electrofishing (4
years prerestoration and 17 years postrestoration)
at multiple restored and unrestored reaches from a
river restoration project on the Lippe River,
Germany. Fish abundance peaked in the third year
after the restoration; abundance was 6 times higher
than before the restoration. After 5-7 years,
species richness and abundance stabilized at 2 and
3.5 times higher levels relative to the
prerestoration level, respectively. However,
interannual variability of species richness and
abundance remained considerable, illustrating the
challenge of reliably assessing restoration outcomes
based on data from individual samplings, especially
in the first years following
restoration. Life-history and reproduction-related
traits best explained differences in species'
responses to restoration. Opportunistic short-lived
species with early female maturity and multiple
spawning runs per year exhibited the strongest
increase in abundance, which reflected their ability
to rapidly colonize new habitats. These often
small-bodied and fusiform fishes typically live in
dynamic and ephemeral instream and floodplain areas
that river-habitat restorations often aim to create,
and in this case their increases in abundance
indicated successful restoration. Our results
suggest that a greater consideration of species'
traits may enhance the causal understanding of
community processes and the coupling of restoration
to functional ecology. Trait-based assessments of
restoration outcomes would furthermore allow for
easier transfer of knowledge across biogeographic
borders than studies based on taxonomy.},
