 abstract = {Motivated by recent global initiatives for
biodiversity conservation and restoration, this
article reviews the gaps in our understanding of,
and the challenges facing, freshwater
macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation in
tropical regions. This study revealed a lack of
adequate taxonomic, phylogenetic, and ecological
information for most macroinvertebrate groups, and
consequently there are large-scale knowledge gaps
regarding the response of macroinvertebrate
diversity to potential climate change and other
human impacts in tropical regions. We propose ideas
to reduce the impact of key drivers of declines in
macroinvertebrate biodiversity, including habitat
degradation and loss, hydrological alteration,
overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and
the multiple impacts of climate change. The review
also provides recommendations to enhance
conservation planning in these systems (as well as
providing clear management plans at local, regional,
and national levels), integrated catchment
management, the formulation of regulatory measures,
the understanding of the determinants of
macroinvertebrate diversity across multiple scales
and taxonomic groups, and the collaboration between
researchers and conservation professionals. It is
suggested that the integrated use of
macroinvertebrate biodiversity information in
biomonitoring can improve ecosystem management. This
goal can be facilitated in part by conservation
psychology, marketing, and the use of the media and
the Internet.},
