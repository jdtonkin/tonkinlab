 abstract = {Chinese rivers are both highly biodiverse and highly
under pressure, hence an urgent need exists to
understand ecological drivers and disentangle
different scales of stressors to support water
management. Our aims were to (1) determine the most
influential variables for benthic invertebrate
occurrence, (2) compare results related to
communities as opposed to metrics and (3) examine
the role of spatial scales with relevance to
management. Benthic invertebrate sampling was
performed at 37 sites in selected tributaries of the
middle reaches of the Yangtze, covering an
environmental gradient with a focus on organic
pollution (stratified sampling design). Ten metrics
commonly used in biomonitoring were derived and
analysed in parallel to assemblage
data. Environmental variables covered 74 parameters
from three different spatial scales, namely local,
reach and catchment scale. We ran a CCA with each of
the three subsets to find out the significant
determining/explanatory variables, followed by pCCA
and pRDA (for metric data) with these variables with
forward selection to determine single variables
important for each subset; we further used variation
portioning for benthic invertebrate data. A high
percentage of overall variability (70 %) of the
assemblage structure was explained, with catchment-
and local-scale variables being almost equally
important. Small-scale variables tended to be more
important than large-scale variables for the
metric-based approach but not for the assemblage
approach. Our results emphasise the need for
spatially explicit regional studies in freshwater
systems and suggest testing multi-metric assessment
approaches to tackle water management and
environmental health questions in China.},
