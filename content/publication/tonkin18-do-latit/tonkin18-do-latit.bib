 abstract = {That biodiversity declines with latitude is well
known, but whether a metacommunity process is behind
this gradient has received limited attention. We
tested the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is
progressively replaced by mass effects with
increasing latitude, along with a series of related
hypotheses. We explored these hypotheses by
examining metacommunity structure in stream
invertebrate metacommunities spanning the length of
New Zealand's two largest islands (~1,300 km),
further disentangling the role of dispersal by
deconstructing assemblages into strong and weak
dispersers. Given the highly dynamic nature of New
Zealand streams, our alternative hypothesis was that
these systems are so unpredictable (at different
stages of post-flood succession) that metacommunity
structure is highly context dependent from region to
region. We rejected our primary hypotheses, pinning
this lack of fit on the strong unpredictability of
New Zealand's dynamic stream ecosystems and fauna
that has evolved to cope with these
conditions. While local community structure turned
over along this latitudinal gradient, metacommunity
structure was highly context dependent and dispersal
traits did not elucidate patterns. Moreover, the
emergent metacommunity types exhibited no trends,
nor did the important environmental variables. These
results provide a cautionary tale for examining
singular metacommunities. The considerable level of
unexplained contingency suggests that any inferences
drawn from one-offsnapshot sampling may be
misleading and further points to the need for more
studies on temporal dynamics of metacommunity
processes.},
