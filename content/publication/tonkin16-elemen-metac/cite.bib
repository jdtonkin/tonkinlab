 abstract = {The elements of metacommunity structure (EMS)
framework gives rise to important ecological
insights through the distinction of metacommunities
into several different idealised structures. We
examined the EMS in assemblages occupying a
low-mountain river system in central Germany,
sampled over three consecutive years. We compared
the idealised distributions of assemblages in both
the riparian floodplain zone (carabid beetles and
spiders) and the benthic instream environment
(benthic invertebrates). We further deconstructed
instream organisms into taxonomic and trait groups
to examine whether greater signal emerges in more
similar species groups. We found little evidence of
strong competition, even for trait-modality groups,
and nestedness was almost non-existent. In addition
to random distributions, Gleasonian distributions
(indicating clear, but individualistic turnover
between sites) were the most commonly identified
structure. Clear differences were apparent between
different trait groups, particularly between
within-trait modalities. These were most evident for
different dispersal modes and life cycle durations,
with strong dispersers showing possible signs of
mass effects. While random distributions may have
partly reflected small sample sizes, clearly
coherent patterns were evident for many groups,
indicating a sufficient gradient in environmental
conditions. The prevalence of random distributions
suggests many species are responding to a variety of
environmental filters in these river-floodplain
metacommunities in an anthropogenically-dominated
landscape, whereas Gleasonian distributions indicate
species are responding idiosyncratically to a
primary environmental gradient. Our findings further
emphasise the prevalence of context dependency
(spatio-temporal variability) in metacommunity
studies, thus we stress the need to further
disentangle the causes of such variation.},
