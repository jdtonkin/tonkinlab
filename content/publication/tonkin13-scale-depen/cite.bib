 abstract = {The effects of productivity and disturbance on
diversity vary widely with the spatial scale at
which they are examined. Not only do productivity
and disturbance have strong infuences on diversity
patterns at local and regional scales but they can
affect the way in which communities assemble and in
turn alter beta diversity or community
dissimilarity. We assessed whether the form of both
the productivity- and disturbance-diversity
relationships differed between the spatial scale at
which they were examined using experimental stream
channels in three Hawke's Bay, New Zealand
streams. In place of true local and regional
richness, we used the proxies within- and
between-stream richness, as well as assessing
between-stream community dissimilarity (similar to
beta diversity). Our results indicate that
productivity and disturbance both affect diversity
but at individual scales and in different forms. At
the within-stream scale, richness was a u shaped
function of productivity whereas at the
between-stream scale richness increased
monotonically with increasing
productivity. Community dissimilarity on the other
hand, increased monotonically with increasing rate
of disturbance. Rather than a greater role of
deterministic assembly with increasing disturbance,
our results indicate the opposite, but it appears
that communities are simply converging on those
found in the surrounding streambed with time since
disturbance. Specifcally, communities were more
similar within individual streams than within
disturbance treatments and animals colonizing
post-disturbance were simply a subset of taxa
present at each site regardless of perceived
colonizing ability, rather than a suite of
specialist colonizing taxa. These results
demonstrate that without a distinction between early
and late colonizers, a greater rate of deterministic
assembly at high disturbance will not occur.},
