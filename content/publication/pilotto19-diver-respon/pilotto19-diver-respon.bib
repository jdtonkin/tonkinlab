 abstract = {Although experiences with ecological restoration
continue to accumulate, the effectiveness of
restoration for biota remains debated. We
complemented a traditional taxonomic analysis
approach with information on 56 species traits to
uncover the responses of 3 aquatic (fish,
macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and 2 terrestrial
(carabid beetles, floodplain vegetation) biotic
groups to 43 hydromorphological river restoration
projects in Germany. All taxonomic groups responded
positively to restoration, as shown by increased
taxonomic richness (10-164%) and trait diversity
(habitat, dispersal and mobility, size, form, life
history, and feeding groups) (15-120%).
Responses, however, were stronger for
terrestrial than aquatic biota, and, contrary to our
expectation, taxonomic responses were stronger than
those of traits. Nevertheless, trait analysis
provided mechanistic insights into the drivers of
community change following restoration. Trait
analysis for terrestrial biota indicated restoration
success was likely enhanced by lateral connectivity
and reestablishment of dynamic processes in the
floodplain. The weaker response of aquatic biota
suggests recovery was hindered by the persistence of
stressors in the aquatic environment, such as
degraded water quality, dispersal constraints, and
insufficient hydromorphological change. Therefore,
river restoration requires combined local- and
regional-scale approaches to maximize the response
of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to
the contrasting responses of aquatic and terrestrial
biota, the planning and assessment of river
restoration outcomes should consider effects on both
components of riverine landscapes.},
