 abstract = {Species reintroductions - the translocation of
individuals to areas in which a species has been
extirpated with the aim of re-establishing a
self-sustaining population - have become a
widespread practice in conservation
biology. Reintroduction projects have tended to
focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, to a lesser
extent, fishes. Much less effort has been devoted to
the reintroduction of invertebrates into restored
freshwater habitats. Yet, reintroductions may
improve restoration outcomes in regions where
impoverished regional species pools limit the
self-recolonisation of restored freshwaters. We
review the available literature on macroinvertebrate
reintroductions, focusing on identifying the
intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine their
success or failure. Our study reveals that
freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions remain
rare, are often published in the grey literature
and, of the attempts made, approximately one-third
fail. We identify life-cycle complexity and
remaining stressors as the two factors most likely
to affect reintroduction success, illustrating the
unique challenges of freshwater macroinvertebrate
reintroductions. Consideration of these factors by
managers during the planning process and proper
documentation - even if a project fails - may
increase the likelihood of successful outcomes in
future reintroduction attempts of freshwater
macroinvertebrates.},
