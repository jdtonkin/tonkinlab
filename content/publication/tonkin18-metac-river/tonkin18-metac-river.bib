 abstract = {Rivers are spatially organised into hierarchic
dendritic networks. This unique physical structure
and the associated directionality of physical flows
set them apart from most other environments by
regulating the dispersal of resident biota and
therefore the distribution of biodiversity. The aim
of this special issue is to highlight the importance
of the river network on structuring biodiversity,
particularly through metacommunity dynamics and
associated dispersal processes. The issue covers a
wide range of topics, including disease spread,
nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of
anthropogenic stressors and the joint roles of
dispersal and environmental filtering. Contributions
employ a broad range of approaches, including field
and laboratory experiments, modelling, population
genetics and conceptual synthesis. Although these
studies represent just a sample of the research that
is being performed on biodiversity and metacommunity
dynamics in river networks, several important
findings have emerged; a common theme being that the
structure of the network and spatial dynamics
clearly influence the dynamics of populations and
communities, and their functions. By taking a broad
taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish),
and spanning a large geographic gradient (from the
tropics to the subarctic), this special issue
provides a broad look at the dynamics that occur in
river networks relating to their unique makeup. We
hope that this selection of studies spurs additional
research on these interesting, globally important,
yet severely threatened ecological systems.},
