 abstract = {Climate warming often results in species range
shifts, biodiversity loss and accumulated climatic
debts of biota (i.e. slower changes in biota than in
temperature). Here, we analyzed the changes in
community composition and temperature signature of
stream invertebrate communities over 25 years
(1990-2014), based on a large set of samples (n =
3782) over large elevation, latitudinal and
longitudinal gradients in central Europe. Although
warming was moderate (average 0.5 $\deg$C), we found
a strong reorganization of stream invertebrate
communities. Total abundance (+35.9%) and
richness (+39.2%) significantly
increased. The share of abundance (TA) and taxonomic
richness (TR) of warm-dwelling taxa (TA: +73.2%; TR: +60.2%) and
medium-temperature-dwelling taxa (TA: +0.4%;
TR: +5.8%) increased too, while
cold-dwelling taxa declined (TA: -61.5%; TR:
-47.3%). The community temperature index,
representing the temperature signature of stream
invertebrate communities, increased at a similar
pace to physical temperature, indicating a
thermophilization of the communities and, for the
first time, no climatic debt. The strongest changes
occurred along the altitudinal gradient, suggesting
that stream invertebrates use the spatial
configuration of river networks to track their
temperature niche uphill. Yet, this may soon come to
an end due to the summit trap effect. Our results
indicate an ongoing process of replacement of
cold-adapted species by thermophilic species at only
0.5 $\deg$C warming, which is particularly alarming
in the light of the more drastic climate warming
projected for coming decades.},
