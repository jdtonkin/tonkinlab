 abstract = {Often simple metrics are used to summarise complex
patterns in stream benthic ecology, thus it is
important to understand how well these metrics can
explain the finer-scale underlying environmental
variation often hidden by coarser-scale
influences. I sampled 47 relatively pristine streams
in the central North Island of New Zealand in 2007
and (1) evaluated the local-scale drivers of
macroinvertebrate community structure as well as
both diversity and biomonitoring metrics in this
unmodified landscape, and (2) assessed whether these
drivers were similar for commonly used univariate
metrics andmultivariate structure. The drivers of
community metrics andmultivariate structure were
largely similar, with %canopy cover and resource
supply metrics the most commonly identified
environmental drivers in these pristine streams. For
an area with little to no anthropogenic influence,
substantial variation was explained in the
macroinvertebrate community (up to 70 % on the
first two components of a partial least squares
regression), with both uni- andmultivariate
approaches. This research highlights two important
points: (1) the importance of considering natural
underlying environmental variation when assessing
the response to coarse environmental gradients, and
(2) the importance of considering canopy cover
presence when assessing the impact of stressors on
stream macroinvertebrate communities.},
