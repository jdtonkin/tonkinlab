abstract: "Cetaceans play key roles in the world’s ecosystems and provide important economic and social benefits. New Zealand’s Exclusive Economic Zone is a global biodiversity hotspot for cetaceans and benefits from a system of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, spatial patterns of cetacean biodiversity and their overlap with MPAs have never been assessed."
