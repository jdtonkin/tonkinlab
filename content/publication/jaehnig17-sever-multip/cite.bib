 abstract = {Given the scientific consensus that climate change
is impacting biodiversity, estimates of future
climate change effects on stream communities and
assessments of potential biases are necessary. Here,
we propose a simple technique to approximate changes
in invertebrate and fish biomonitoring results. Taxa
lists for 60 (invertebrate) and 52 (fish) sites were
each modified by 10 multipliers as stepwise 5 % or
10 % changes in abundances to simulate potential
climate-change severity, reflecting increasing
climate change effects. These 10 multipliers were
based on the stream zonation preference for
invertebrates and the Fish Region Index (FRI) values
for fish, both reflecting the longitudinal gradient
present in river ecosystems. The original and
modified taxa lists were analyzed using the standard
assessment software for the particular group,
followed by analysis of key biomonitoring
metrics. For invertebrates, our simulations affected
small good quality streams more often negatively
while large poor mountain streams showed a tendency
to improve. Forty percent of the invertebrate data
sites showed a change in the final ecological
assessment class when using the multipliers, with
the poor quality sites changing more often. For
fish, metric changes were variable, but the FRI
ratio showed mostly positive responses, i.e., a
shift in FRI towards downstream communities. The
results are discussed as an example that facilitates
the interpretation of potential climate-change
effects with varying severity. Further, we discuss
the simplified approach and implications for
assessment from climate change induced range
shifts.},
