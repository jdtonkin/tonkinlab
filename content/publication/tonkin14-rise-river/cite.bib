 abstract = {Rivers worldwide are under increasing threat from
hydrologic alteration. Managing for environmental
flows (E-flows) is one way of dealing with this, but
research remains heavily focused on development of
methods for setting flows. We examined trends in
riverine flow-ecology research (the link between the
flow regime and biota of a river) from 1995 to 2012
internationally by assessing publication rate of all
countries combined and identifying trends in
research specifically on E-flows. USA dominated the
research output in flow-ecology research, but
Australian researchers were the most active on
E-flows. We show that E-flow research has
exponentially expanded since the mid 1990s, both in
number and as a percentage of general river
research. E-flow research productivity also
increased weakly with the number of dams and
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) of
countries, highlighting that this research is
performed mostly in developed countries. We expect
this trend will continue and suggest that E-flow
research needs to be incorporated into policy in
low-GDP countries to ensure healthy viable river
ecosystems.},
