 abstract = {It is broadly acknowledged that freshwater
ecosystems are affected by multiple stressors, but
the relative importance of individual stressors in
impairing riverine communities remains unclear. We
investigated the impacts of multiple stressors,
incorporating in-stream water quality, riparian and
catchment land use and stream morphology, on
riverine benthic invertebrate communities, while
considering the spatial scales of factors and the
heterogeneity of riverscapes. We performed a
stepwise regression procedure linking 21 abiotic and
20 community metrics using Generalized Linear Models
on data from 1018 river sites spread across
Germany. High impact stressors (e.g., nutrients and
water temperature) were identified for various
community metrics. Both the combination of relevant
stressors and their explanatory value differed
significantly across streams of different sizes and
ecoregions. In large rivers, the riparian land use
was less important in determining community
structure compared to lower order streams. Thus,
possible mitigating effects of revegetated riparian
buffer strips are likely to be overwhelmed by the
influence of catchment-wide land use. Our results
indicated substantial variability in stressors for
the range of metrics studied, providing insight into
potential target parameters for effective ecosystem
management. To achieve long lasting successes in
managing, protecting and restoring running waters,
it is of vital importance to recognize the
heterogeneity of riverscapes and to consider
large-scale influences.},
