 abstract = {River ecosystems receive and process vast quantities
of terrestrial organic carbon, the fate of which
depends strongly on microbial activity. Variation in
and controls of processing rates, however, are
poorly characterized at the global scale. In
response, we used a peer-sourced research network
and a highly standardized carbon processing assay to
conduct a global-scale field experiment in greater
than 1000 river and riparian sites. We found that
Earth's biomes have distinct carbon processing
signatures. Slow processing is evident across
latitudes, whereas rapid rates are restricted to
lower latitudes. Both the mean rate and variability
decline with latitude, suggesting temperature
constraints toward the poles and greater roles for
other environmental drivers (e.g., nutrient loading)
toward the equator. These results and data set the
stage for unprecedented "next-generation
biomonitoring" by establishing baselines to help
quantify environmental impacts to the functioning of
ecosystems at a global scale.},
