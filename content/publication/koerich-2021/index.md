abstract: Given the ecological and biogeochemical importance of rhodolith beds, it
  is necessary to investigate how future environmental conditions will affect these
  organisms. We investigated the impacts of increased nutrient concentrations, acidification,
  and marine heatwaves on the performance of the rhodolith-forming species Lithothamnion
  crispatum in a short-term experiment, including the recovery of individuals after
  stressor removal. Furthermore, we developed an ecological niche model to establish
  which environmental conditions determine its current distribution along the Brazilian
  coast and to project responses to future climate scenarios. Although L. crispatum
  suffered a reduction in photosynthetic performance when exposed to stressors, they
  returned to pre-experiment values following the return of individuals to control
  conditions. The model showed that the most important variables in explaining the
  current distribution of L. crispatum on the Brazilian coast were maximum nitrate
  and temperature. In future ocean conditions, the model predicted a range expansion
  of habitat suitability for this species of approximately 58.5% under RCP 8.5. Physiological
  responses to experimental future environmental conditions corroborated model predictions
  of the expansion of this species’ habitat suitability in the future. This study,
  therefore, demonstrates the benefits of applying combined approaches to examine
  potential species responses to climate-change drivers from multiple angles. © 2021
