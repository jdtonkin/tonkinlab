 abstract = {Understanding factors that structure regional
biodiversity is important for linking ecological and
biogeographic processes. Our objective was to
explore regional patterns in riverine benthic
invertebrate assemblages in relation to their broad
positioning along the river network and examine
differences in composition, biodiversity (alpha and
beta diversity), and environmental drivers. We
up-scaled methods used to examine patterns in
metacommunity structure (Elements of Metacommunity
Structure framework) to examine faunal distribution
patterns at the regional extent for 168 low-mountain
stream invertebrate assemblages in central
Germany. We then identified the most influential
environmental factors using boosted regression
trees. Faunal composition patterns were
compartmentalised (Clementsian or
quasi-Clementsian), with little difference from
headwaters to large rivers, potentially reflecting
the regional scale of the study, by crossing major
catchment boundaries and incorporating different
species pools. While idealised structures did not
vary, environmental drivers of composition varied
considerably between river sections and with alpha
diversity. Prediction was substantially weaker, and
the importance of space was greater, in large rivers
compared to other sections suggesting a weakening in
species sorting downstream. Further, there was a
stronger transition in composition than for alpha
diversity downstream. The stronger links with
regional faunal composition than with richness
further emphasises the importance of considering the
alternative ways in which anthropogenic stressors
are operating to affect biodiversity patterns. Our
approach allowed bridging the gap between local (or
metacommunity) and regional scales, providing key
insights into drivers of regional biodiversity
patterns.},
