 abstract = {We assessed the effects of patch complexity on
benthic macroinvertebrate colonisation and leaf
breakdown in three headwater streams in the Kaimai
Range, New Zealand. We used three patch types:
complex, disturbed, and unaltered control patches,
and measured colonisation of macroinvertebrates and
leaf breakdown rates within each patch. We
hypothesised colonisation and breakdown would be
highest in the complex patches and lowest in
disturbed patches. With the exception of percentage
of total shredders, no differences were found in
macroinvertebrate diversity or community structure
and no treatment effect was evident for leaf
breakdown rates. While this may suggest no influence
of patch complexity on leaf breakdown, we cannot
discount unmeasured site-specific influences, such
as a high flow event, which occurred during the
treatment period, as clear differences were evident
between the three streams. Higher spatiotemporal
replication and more appropriate seasonal sampling
would be required to further explore this
relationship.},
