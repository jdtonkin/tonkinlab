 abstract = {Understanding the drivers of community structure is
fundamental for adequately managing ecosystems under
global change. Here we used a large dataset of
eighty-four headwater stream sites in three
catchments in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe,
which represent a variety of abiotic conditions and
levels of impairment, to examine the drivers of
benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. We
focused our assessment on macroinvertebrate family
level community composition and functional feeding
group classifications. Taxonomic richness was weakly
positively correlated with ammonium, phosphates and
pH, and weakly negatively correlated with detrital
cover and dissolved oxygen. Measured abiotic
variables, however, had limited influence on both
macroinvertebrate diversity and functional feeding
group structure, with the exception of ammonium,
channel width and phosphates. This reflected the
fact that many macroinvertebrate families and
functional feeding guilds were well represented
across a broad range of habitats. Predatory
macroinvertebrates were relatively abundant, with
collector-filterers having the lowest relative
abundances. The findings of the study suggest that
for certain ecological questions, a more detailed
taxonomic resolution may be required to adequately
understand the ecology of aquatic macroinvertebrates
within river systems. We further recommend
management and conservation initiatives on the Save
River system, which showed significant impact from
catchment developmental pressures, such as
urbanisation, agriculture and illegal mining.},
