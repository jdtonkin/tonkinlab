 abstract = {Productivity and disturbance have a strong role in
determining diversity patterns in nature yet whether
they operate individually or interact to determine
diversity is unclear. Moreover, what effect land‐use
change has on this relationship has not been
assessed. We tested whether land use influenced the
relationship between productivity, disturbance and
diversity, and assessed the fit of three
productivity‐disturbance‐diversity models, using
data from multiple samplings of 16 streams in two
contrasting regions of the North Island of New
Zealand. As the Dynamic Equilibrium Model (DEM) has
received inconsistent support in all ecosystems and
little favorable applications in lotic systems, we
applied this along with two previously developed for
stream communities. Although the community structure
differed between the two regions, the response of
taxonomic richness to productivity and disturbance
was consistent. That is, richness was log‐linearly
related to productivity and declined monotonically
with disturbance. However, there was no evidence of
an interactive effect of productivity and
disturbance. When accounting for density
(rarefaction) the results were inconsistent,
exhibiting no relationship with productivity but
declining with disturbance. Our results suggest both
the Death and Tonkin
productivity‐disturbance‐diversity models are the
most applicable in these communities where
disturbance simply removes taxa and productivity
controls the upper limit to richness.},
