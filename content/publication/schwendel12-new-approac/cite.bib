 abstract = {Composition and structure of lotic ecosystems can be
affected by substrate instability. Consequently
stream ecologists have used various methods to
determine bed stability characteristics. However,
the link between community composition and these
measurements varies because benthic biota often
responds to combinations of bed stability
characteristics. This paper presents a protocol to
determine reach-scale stream bed stability in
mountain streams which is relevant for invertebrate
communities (Stream Bed Stability for Invertebrates,
SBSI). The approach is calibrated on community
composition response to bed stability but does not
measure any single bed stability characteristic per
se. It consists of 13 parameters that are assessed
once at each reach with minimal instrumentation and
low interference with the substrate. These 13
parameters cover aspects of sediment supply from
banks, transport capacity and substrate erodibility
as well as effects of particle transport on channel
bottom structures, substrate assemblage and single
grains. Application of the SBSI protocol improved
the relationship between bed stability and community
diversity compared to when conventional bed
stability measures were employed. The SBSI protocol
provides a cost-effective and time-effective
assessment method for bed stability and its
application can facilitate research on invertebrate
community response to physical disturbance.},
