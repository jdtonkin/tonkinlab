 abstract = {Micro-estuaries and micro-outlets represent small
coastal waterbodies that differ in their relative
salinity and size, with the former being larger,
more saline (mesohaline versus oligohaline), and
exchanging with the sea more often than the
latter. There are thousands of these waterbodies
along the world's coastline, yet few of these very
small systems have been identified and studied. We
investigated systematic differences between
micro-estuaries and micro-outlets in terms of
phytoplankton community composition, including
spatio-temporal variation in both community
structure and biomass (chlorophyll-a). A
multivariate analysis was used to assess differences
in environmental variables, biomass and
phytoplankton community composition across four
seasons and the two waterbody types. A total of 260
(63 families) and 244 (74 families) phytoplankton
taxa were identified within the micro-estuaries and
micro-outlets, respectively. Nano- and picoplankton
were the dominant groups in micro-estuaries, and
pico- and microplankton in
micro-outlets. Micro-estuaries were rich in
phytoplankton taxa representative of marine,
estuarine and freshwater conditions, with a
successional sequence in dominance evident, from
Chlorophyta during winter to Bacillariophyta in
spring and Cyanophyta in summer. By contrast,
micro-outlets were mostly dominated by freshwater
taxa, with Chlorophyta remaining the dominant group
across all four seasons. Higher phytoplankton
biomass was recorded during the winter when
increased nutrients were available following
catchment flooding. Seasonal switching in
phytoplankton was reflected not only in changing
dominance patterns in both habitat types but also in
complete replacement of some species in
micro-outlets, despite Chlorophyta remaining
dominant. Such temporal turnover, which is often
accompanied by predictable seasonal changes in
environmental conditions, can promote overall
species richness by allowing more taxa to coexist in
a single environment through temporal niche
segregation.},
