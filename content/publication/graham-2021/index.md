abstract: 'Disturbances fundamentally alter ecosystem functions, yet predicting their
  impacts remains a key scientific challenge. While the study of disturbances is ubiquitous
  across many ecological disciplines, there is no agreed-upon, cross-disciplinary
  foundation for discussing or quantifying the complexity of disturbances, and no
  consistent terminology or methodologies exist. This inconsistency presents an increasingly
  urgent challenge due to accelerating global change and the threat of interacting
  disturbances that can destabilize ecosystem responses. By harvesting the expertise
  of an interdisciplinary cohort of contributors spanning 42 institutions across 15
  countries, we identified an essential limitation in disturbance ecology: the word
  ‘disturbance’ is used interchangeably to refer to both the events that cause, and
  the consequences of, ecological change, despite fundamental distinctions between
  the two meanings. In response, we developed a generalizable framework of ecosystem
  disturbances, providing a well-defined lexicon for understanding disturbances across
  perspectives and scales. The framework results from ideas that resonate across multiple
  scientific disciplines and provides a baseline standard to compare disturbances
  across fields. This framework can be supplemented by discipline-specific variables
  to provide maximum benefit to both inter- and intra-disciplinary research. To support
  future syntheses and meta-analyses of disturbance research, we also encourage researchers
  to be explicit in how they define disturbance drivers and impacts, and we recommend
  minimum reporting standards that are applicable regardless of scale. Finally, we
  discuss the primary factors we considered when developing a baseline framework and
  propose four future directions to advance our interdisciplinary understanding of
  disturbances and their social-ecological impacts: integrating across ecological
  scales, understanding disturbance interactions, establishing baselines and trajectories,
  and developing process-based models and ecological forecasting initiatives. Our
  experience through this process motivates us to encourage the wider scientific community
  to continue to explore new approaches for leveraging Open Science principles in
  generating creative and multidisciplinary ideas. © Copyright © 2021 Graham, Averill,
