abstract: 'There is increasing interest in measuring ecological stability to understand
  how communities and ecosystems respond to broad-scale global changes. One of the
  most common approaches is to quantify the variation through time in community or
  ecosystem aggregate attributes (e.g. total biomass), referred to as aggregate variability.
  It is now widely recognized that aggregate variability represents only one aspect
  of communities and ecosystems, and compositional variability, the changes in the
  relative frequency of species in an assemblage, is equally important. Recent contributions
  have also begun to explore ecological stability at regional spatial scales, where
  interconnected local communities form metacommunities, a key concept in managing
  complex landscapes. However, the conceptual frameworks and measures of ecological
  stability in space have only focused on aggregate variability, leaving a conceptual
  gap. Here, we address this gap with a novel framework for quantifying the aggregate
  and compositional variability of communities and ecosystems through space and time.
  We demonstrate that the compositional variability of a metacommunity depends on
  the degree of spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among local communities.
  We then provide a conceptual framework in which compositional variability of 1)
  the metacommunity through time and 2) among local communities combine into four
  archetype scenarios: spatial stasis (low/low), spatial synchrony (high/low), spatial
  asynchrony (high/high) and spatial compensation (low/high). We illustrate this framework
  based on numerical examples and a case study of a macroalgal metacommunity in which
  low spatial synchrony reduced variability in aggregate biomass at the metacommunity
  scale, while masking high spatial synchrony in compositional trajectories among
  local communities. Finally, we discuss the role of dispersal, environmental heterogeneity,
  species interactions and suggest future avenues. We believe this framework will
  be helpful for considering both aspects of variability simultaneously, which is
  important to better understand ecological stability in natural and complex landscapes
  in response to environmental changes. Â© 2021 The Authors. Oikos published by John
