 abstract = {Although most stream restoration projects succeed in
improving hydromorphological habitat quality, the
ecological quality of the stream communities often
remains unaffected. We hypothesize that this is
because stream communities are largely determined by
environmental properties at a larger-than-local
spatial scale. Using benthic invertebrate community
data as well as hydromorphological habitat quality
data from 1087 stream sites, we investigated the
role of local- (i.e. 100 m reach) and regional-scale
(i.e. 5 km ring centered on each reach) stream
hydromorphological habitat quality (LQ and RQ,
respectively) on benthic invertebrate
communities. The analyses showed that RQ had a
greater individual effect on communities than LQ,
but the effects of RQ and LQ interacted. Where RQ
was either good or poor, communities were
exclusively determined by RQ. Only in areas of
intermediate RQ, LQ determined
communities. Metacommunity analysis helped to
explain these findings. Species pools in poor RQ
areas were most depauperated, resulting in
insufficient propagule pressure for species
establishment even at high LQ (e.g. restored)
sites. Conversely, higher alpha diversity and an
indication of lower beta dispersion signals at mass
effects occurring in high RQ areas. That is,
abundant neighboring populations may help to
maintain populations even at sites with low LQ. The
strongest segregation in species co-occurrence was
detected at intermediate RQ levels, suggesting that
communities are structured to the highest degree by
a habitat/environmental gradient. From these
results, we conclude that when restoring riverine
habitats at the reach scale, restoration projects
situated in intermediate RQ settings will likely be
the most successful in enhancing the naturalness of
local communities. With a careful choice of sites
for reach-scale restoration in settings of
intermediate RQ and a strategy that aims to expand
areas of high RQ, the success of reach-scale
restoration in promoting the ecological quality of
communities can be greatly improved. },
