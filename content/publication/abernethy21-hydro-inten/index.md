abstract: Abstract River biodiversity is threatened globally by hydropower dams, and
  there is a need to understand how dam management favors certain species while filtering
  out others. We examined aquatic invertebrate communities within the tailwaters 0–24 km
  downstream of seven large hydropower dams in the Colorado River Basin of the western
  United States. We quantified aquatic invertebrate dominance, richness, abundance,
  and biomass at multiple locations within individual tailwaters and across the basin
  and identified biological community responses associated with dam operations and
  distance from dam. We found that each tailwater was dominated by 3–7 invertebrate
  taxa, accounting for 95% of total abundance. Half of these dominant taxa were non-insect,
  non-flying species and thus were unavailable to terrestrial consumers. Consistent
  with previous studies, aquatic insects and sensitive taxa were negatively associated
  with hydropeaking intensity (magnitude of daily flow fluctuations associated with
  hydropower generation), which limits the composition and potentially the quality
  of the invertebrate food base. While total invertebrate abundance and biomass did
  not change with increasing distance downstream from dams, insect and sensitive taxa
  richness, abundance, and biomass all increased, suggesting that impacts of hydropeaking
  are most acute immediately downstream of dams. Our results demonstrate that tailwaters
  experiencing hydropeaking support high abundances of aquatic invertebrate, but the
  diversity of these communities is low.
