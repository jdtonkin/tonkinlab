 abstract = {Culvert pipes are regularly used around the world
for conveying stream flows underground, through
embankments or under road crossings. Installation of
these features can have significant negative effects
on the passage of freshwater biota and potentially
exclude many species from large areas of river
networks. We investigated the installation of mussel
spat ropes as a potentially rapid and cost-effective
tool for improving passage of freshwater biota
through culvert pipes where internal barrel
conditions impede passage. We assessed passage
success for two fish species, juvenile rainbow trout
Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum 1972) and adult inanga
Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns 1842), and one migratory
shrimp, Paratya curvirostris (Heller 1862), through
culverts of differing length (3 and 6 m), slope (1·5
and 3$\deg$) and flow (0·24 and 0·75 L s-1). We
hypothesized that ropes would enhance the passage
success of these three species, but success rates
would differ between species and trial
combinations. Ropes resulted in a reduced water
velocity within culvert barrels and significantly
improved passage success for all three
species. Shrimp benefited most by the presence of
ropes, being unable to negotiate any of the pipe
combinations in their absence, but exhibiting
varying rates of success across all combinations
with their presence. Both G. maculatus and O. mykiss
were able to negotiate some of the non-roped pipe
combinations, but as the level of difficulty
increased, successful passage was only achieved with
the ropes present. Synthesis and applications. We
conclude that this relatively inexpensive and
easy-to-install tool has the potential to
substantially improve passage for a range of aquatic
biota through various culvert scenarios. We consider
that ropes would be particularly useful in
situations where internal culvert access is
difficult and where various culvert parameters
(slope, flow, length) result in internal barrel
hydraulics that would normally limit or exclude
passage of aquatic biota.},
