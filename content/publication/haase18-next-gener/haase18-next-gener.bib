 abstract = {Global change effects on biodiversity and human
wellbeing call for improved long-term environmental
data as a basis for science, policy and decision
making, including increased interoperability,
multifunctionality, and harmonization. Based on the
example of two global initiatives, the International
Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network and
the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity
Observation Network (GEO BON), we propose merging
the frameworks behind these initiatives, namely
ecosystem integrity and essential biodiversity
variables, to serve as an improved guideline for
future site-based long-term research and monitoring
in terrestrial, freshwater and coastal
ecosystems. We derive a list of specific
recommendations of what and how to measure at a
monitoring site and call for an integration of sites
into co-located site networks across individual
monitoring initiatives, and centered on
ecosystems. This facilitates the generation of
linked comprehensive ecosystem monitoring data,
supports synergies in the use of costly
infrastructures, fosters cross-initiative research
and provides a template for collaboration beyond the
ILTER and GEO BON communities.},
