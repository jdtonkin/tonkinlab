 abstract = {Long-term observations on riverine benthic
invertebrate communities enable assessments of the
potential impacts of global change on stream
ecosystems. Besides increasing average temperatures,
many studies predict greater temperature extremes
and intense precipitation events as a consequence of
climate change. In this study we examined long-term
observation data (10-32 years) of 26 streams and
rivers from four ecoregions in the European
Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, to
investigate invertebrate community responses to
changing climatic conditions. We used functional
trait and multi-taxonomic analyses and combined
examinations of general long-term changes in
communities with detailed analyses of the impact of
different climatic drivers (i.e., various
temperature and precipitation variables) by focusing
on the response of communities to climatic
conditions of the previous year. Taxa and ecoregions
differed substantially in their response to climate
change conditions. We did not observe any trend of
changes in total taxonomic richness or overall
abundance over time or with increasing temperatures,
which reflects a compensatory turnover in the
composition of communities; sensitive Plecoptera
decreased in response to warmer years and
Ephemeroptera increased in northern
regions. Invasive species increased with an
increasing number of extreme days which also caused
an apparent upstream community movement. The
observed changes in functional feeding group
diversity indicate that climate change may be
associated with changes in trophic interactions
within aquatic food webs. These findings highlight
the vulnerability of riverine ecosystems to climate
change and emphasize the need to further explore the
interactive effects of climate change variables with
other local stressors to develop appropriate
conservation measures.},
