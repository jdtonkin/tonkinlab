abstract: 'River managers strive to use the best available science to sustain biodiversity
  and ecosystem function. To achieve this goal requires consideration of processes
  at different scales. Metacommunity theory describes how multiple species from different
  communities potentially interact with local-scale environmental drivers to influence
  population dynamics and community structure. However, this body of knowledge has
  only rarely been used to inform management practices for river ecosystems. In this
  article, we present a conceptual model outlining how the metacommunity processes
  of local niche sorting and dispersal can influence the outcomes of management interventions
  and provide a series of specific recommendations for applying these ideas as well
  as research needs. In all cases, we identify situations where traditional approaches
  to riverine management could be enhanced by incorporating an understanding of metacommunity
  dynamics. A common theme is developing guidelines for assessing the metacommunity
  context of a site or region, evaluating how that context may affect the desired
  outcome, and incorporating that understanding into the planning process and methods
  used. To maximize the effectiveness of management activities, scientists, and resource
  managers should update the toolbox of approaches to riverine management to reflect
  theoretical advances in metacommunity ecology. This article is categorized under:
