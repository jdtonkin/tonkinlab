 abstract = {Downstream drift plays a fundamental role in the
spatial distribution and community structure of
lotic macroinvertebrates. We sampled both benthic
and drifting macroinvertebrates at 15 sites, in
three sections of river with varying flow alteration
along the Tongariro River, New Zealand. Our
objectives were to examine whether (i) benthic and
drift density were linearly related throughout the
river, (ii) the presence of dams affected the
propensity of macroinvertebrates to drift, and (iii)
drift propensity was related to benthic periphyton
biomass or natural longitudinal patterns down the
river. More taxa were collected from the drift than
the benthos, although drift and benthic samples were
generally taxonomically similar, despite some
structural differences. Nonetheless, differences
were evident between the major groups when assessing
density and relative abundance links between the
benthos and drift. The presence of dams did not
affect the propensity of macroinvertebrates to drift
on the whole, nor was propensity affected by
periphyton biomass or distance from source. These
results suggest that although altered periphyton
biomass in downstream sections in the Tongariro
River is altering the composition of benthic and
drifting macroinvertebrates, drift propensity is
unaffected. However, some deviations from linear
relationships between benthic and drift density are
evident suggesting these links may be taxon
specific.},
