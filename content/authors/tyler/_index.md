Following six years as an aircraft mechanic in the United States Air Force, I began my academic career with the completion of my B.S. at the Ohio State University where I studied environmental science and restoration ecology. I then moved to the high desert Ponderosa pine system of the Colorado Plateau to study community and trait-based ecology with Rachel Mitchell at Northern Arizona University where my current research focuses on quantifying the effects of climate and management decisions on two perennial bunchgrass species. I am developing integral projection models that will be used to predict survival and growth of these two species (Festuca arizonica and Muhlenbergia montana) in response to changing environmental conditions and increased forest stand density due to historic fire suppression. 

I am broadly interested in community ecology and the role that modelling plays in preparing us for the ecological and societal implications of anthropogenic climate change.  I am excited to join the Tonkin Lab at the University of Canterbury in order to further the mechanistic understanding of flow alteration on riverine communities in a changing world.
