Originally from North Carolina in the U.S., I came to Christchurch in 2020 to complete my MSc. Previously I had worked several jobs in agricultural pest research, mostly in rearing insect pest species. While I loved rearing these insects, my passion lies more with researching how to preserve insect biodiversity and conserve threatened species, so I decided to get into this field by travelling to Aotearoa New Zealand. Recently, I finished my MSc with Prof Dave Kelly, where we investigated long-term changes in a tussock grassland moth community at Cass. My scholarship is focused on a meta-analysis on the role of demographic compensation in buffering populations from climate change.
