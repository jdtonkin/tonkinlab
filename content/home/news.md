**Jul. 2021 » _New positions available!** We have two positions currently available in the same project: (working with Jason Tylianakis) one Postdoc and one PhD. Check out our vacancies page for these positions on metacommunity and evolutionary drivers of resilience.

**Jul. 2021 » _Jono on TVNZ Breakfast talking about the CBD Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework._** Jono talked to John Campbell on Breakfast TV about the latest UN Convention on Biological Diversity's draft Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework.  

**Jul. 2021 » _Welcome Gabrielle!_** We're delighted to welcome Gabrielle Koerich to the team as a PhD student. Gabrielle will be working with Jono on forecasting species responses to climate change in the Ross Sea Region of Antarctica, as part of the Antarctic Science Platform. 

**Jun. 2021 » _Welcome Anne!_** We're delighted to welcome Anne Mcleod to the team as a Postdoc. Anne will be collaborating with Jono on some exciting new community theory modelling spanning from metacommunity models to food web models to ecosystem models. 

**Jun. 2021 » _Paper out on hydropeaking effects in the Colorado River._** Thanks to Erin for leading this great work! 

**May 2021 » _New paper in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment._** Jono's paper on designing flow regimes to support entire river ecosystems is now out in Frontiers. Thanks to the great coauthors: Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Dave Merritt, Lindsay Reynolds and Jane Rogosch! 

**Apr. 2021 » _Opening PhD call up to international students_.** I have a new PhD position available on forecasting fish species vulnerability to climate change. Please see the opportunities page. 

**Feb. 2021 » _Several new publications added_.** Jono has been involved in several new papers that have come out (now uploaded to the website), including work highlighting the benefits of long-term spatially replicated datasets for advancing metacommunity theory and issues surrounding assigning causal drivers of long-term trends in insect abundances.  

**Oct. 2020 » _Bio-Protection Aotearoa and Te Pūnaha Matatini funded for eight years_.** Last week, the next round of NZ Centres of Research Excellence were announced. Jono is delighted that two of the CoREs he is involved in have been funded for the next eight years: Bio-Protection Aotearoa and Te Pūnaha Matatini. There will be new positions advertised here in the coming months. 

**Sept. 2020 » _Paper accepted in Global Change Biology_.** Jono has just had a co-authored paper on taxonomic homogenisation but functional differentiation among stream macroinvertebrate assemblages under climate change. This effort was led by Théophile Mouton. More soon. 

**Aug 2020 » _Paper accepted in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment_.** Jono has just had a paper on designing flow regimes to support entire river ecosystems accepted for publication in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. More soon. 

**June 2020 » _New funding to forecast fish species response to changing flow regimes_.** Jono recently received funding to develop new models to forecast how native NZ fish will respond to climate-induced changes to flow regimes. Stay tuned for a new PhD advertisement coming soon. 

**Feb 2020 » _Paper coming soon on conservation of aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in tropical regions_.** This should be available in the next few weeks in _Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems_. 

**Dec 2019 » _News piece on our Nature paper_.** Karla Lant at the Environmental Monitor recently published this really nice news piece on our river management perspective piece [here](https://www.fondriest.com/news/river-management-on-a-changing-planet.htm).  

**Oct 2019 » _Permanent position_.** Jono received the news that he has a permanent position at the University of Canterbury in the fabulous School of Biological Sciences. He's delighted to get to set down roots and build a flourishing research lab in his home country of New Zealand. 

**Sept 2019 » _New Tonkin Lab website_.** Welcome to the new-look Tonkin Lab website. Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming opportunities to join the lab. 

**June 2019 » _New paper in Nature_.** Our paper on preparing river ecosystems for an uncertain future came out in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01877-1). It was a real treat to work with such a great group of colleagues on this one: LeRoy Poff, Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Nick Bond, Avril Horne, Albert Ruhi, Lindsay Reynolds and Dave Merritt. 

**April 2019 » _New paper in Ecosphere._** We have a new paper out in [Ecosphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2681). This is a multi-species demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes in the Verde River, Arizona. Projecting the model beyond the survey data predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant community, which was linked to increasing drought frequency. Thanks very much for leading this effort, Jane!

**Dec 2018 » _Paper accepted in Sci. Tot. Env_.** We just had a paper accepted led by Peter Haase, Francesca Pilotto and Fengqing Li. This has been a long road, so it's nice to see it through review. The title gives the central result: Moderate warming over the past 25 years has already reorganized stream invertebrate communities. 

**Dec 2018 » _Paper accepted in River Research and Applications_.** We just had a paper accepted on: The three Rs of river ecosystem resilience: Resources, Recruitment and Refugia. Thanks to Kris Van Looy for leading this. This originated at a workshop in Berlin back in 2015, so it's nice to see it come through in the end. 

**Dec 2018 » _Awarded the inaugural NZFSS Early Career Researcher Award_.** Last week, Jono received the inaugural Early Career Researcher Award by the New Zealand Freshwater Sciences Society. Jono is very grateful to both the Society for giving him the award and the many colleagues that have helped him to get where he is today. It meant he got to share his past few years of research with the society by way of a keynote address. 

**Oct 2018 » _Awarded a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship_.** Jono is delighted and honoured to receive a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship from the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi. The title of his 5-year programme is "Rethinking ecological networks in changing environments". The fellowship will allow him to build his research programme here in New Zealand after several years overseas, and provide the time to tackle major environmental challenges in a way that is not necessarily possible over shorter timescales. News releases [here](https://royalsociety.org.nz/news/2018-rutherford-discovery-fellowships-to-accelerate-research-careers-announced/) and [here](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2018/uc-ecologist-awarded-800000-to-tackle-major-environmental-challenges.html).
