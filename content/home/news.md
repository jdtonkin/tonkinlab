**June 2020 » _New funding to forecast fish species response to changing flow regimes_.** Jono recently received funding to develop new models to forecast how native NZ fish will respond to climate-induced changes to flow regimes. Stay tuned for a new PhD advertisement coming soon.

**Feb 2020 » _Paper coming soon on conservation of aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in tropical regions_.** This should be available in the next few weeks in _Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems_. 

**Dec 2019 » _News piece on our Nature paper_.** Karla Lant at the Environmental Monitor recently published this really nice news piece on our river management perspective piece [here](https://www.fondriest.com/news/river-management-on-a-changing-planet.htm).  

**Oct 2019 » _Permanent position_.** Jono received the news that he has a permanent position at the University of Canterbury in the fabulous School of Biological Sciences. He's delighted to get to set down roots and build a flourishing research lab in his home country of New Zealand. 

**Sept 2019 » _New Tonkin Lab website_.** Welcome to the new-look Tonkin Lab website. Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming opportunities to join the lab. 

**June 2019 » _New paper in Nature_.** Our paper on preparing river ecosystems for an uncertain future came out in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01877-1). It was a real treat to work with such a great group of colleagues on this one: LeRoy Poff, Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Nick Bond, Avril Horne, Albert Ruhi, Lindsay Reynolds and Dave Merritt. 

**April 2019 » _New paper in Ecosphere._** We have a new paper out in [Ecosphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2681). This is a multi-species demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes in the Verde River, Arizona. Projecting the model beyond the survey data predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant community, which was linked to increasing drought frequency. Thanks very much for leading this effort, Jane!

**Dec 2018 » _Paper accepted in Sci. Tot. Env_.** We just had a paper accepted led by Peter Haase, Francesca Pilotto and Fengqing Li. This has been a long road, so it's nice to see it through review. The title gives the central result: Moderate warming over the past 25 years has already reorganized stream invertebrate communities. 

**Dec 2018 » _Paper accepted in River Research and Applications_.** We just had a paper accepted on: The three Rs of river ecosystem resilience: Resources, Recruitment and Refugia. Thanks to Kris Van Looy for leading this. This originated at a workshop in Berlin back in 2015, so it's nice to see it come through in the end. 

**Dec 2018 » _Awarded the inaugural NZFSS Early Career Researcher Award_.** Last week, Jono received the inaugural Early Career Researcher Award by the New Zealand Freshwater Sciences Society. Jono is very grateful to both the Society for giving him the award and the many colleagues that have helped him to get where he is today. It meant he got to share his past few years of research with the society by way of a keynote address. 

**Oct 2018 » _Awarded a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship_.** Jono is delighted and honoured to receive a Rutherford Discovery Fellowship from the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi. The title of his 5-year programme is "Rethinking ecological networks in changing environments". The fellowship will allow him to build his research programme here in New Zealand after several years overseas, and provide the time to tackle major environmental challenges in a way that is not necessarily possible over shorter timescales. News releases [here](https://royalsociety.org.nz/news/2018-rutherford-discovery-fellowships-to-accelerate-research-careers-announced/) and [here](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2018/uc-ecologist-awarded-800000-to-tackle-major-environmental-challenges.html).
