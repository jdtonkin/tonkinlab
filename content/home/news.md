**Oct 2019 » _Permanent position_.** Jono received the news that he has a permanent position at the University of Canterbury in the fabulous School of Biological Sciences. He's delighted to get to set down roots and build a flourishing research lab in his home country of New Zealand. 

**Sept 2019 » _New Tonkin Lab website_.** Welcome to the new-look Tonkin Lab website. Keep your eyes peeled for upcoming opportunities to join the lab. 

**June 2019 » _New paper in Nature_.** Our paper on preparing river ecosystems for an uncertain future came out in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01877-1). It was a real treat to work with such a great group of colleagues on this one: LeRoy Poff, Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Nick Bond, Avril Horne, Albert Ruhi, Lindsay Reynolds and Dave Merritt. 

**April 2019 » _New paper in Ecosphere._** We have a new paper out in [Ecosphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2681). This is a multi-species demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes in the Verde River, Arizona. Projecting the model beyond the survey data predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant community, which was linked to increasing drought frequency. Thanks very much for leading this effort, Jane!
