**June 2019** » *New paper in Nature.* Our paper on preparing river ecosystems for an uncertain future came out in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01877-1). We make a call for a change in the way we manage and model river ecosystems, arguing that we can no longer aim to restore river ecosystems to historical or ‘natural’ states, because often, and increasingly, those states no longer exist. We also suggest that models that are based on past correlations do poorly looking into the future for how species may respond to unprecedented changes. We call for rivers to be managed adaptively and for researchers to develop forecasting tools that move beyond simply monitoring the state of ecosystems to establishing the biological mechanisms that underpin their survival. It was a real treat to work with such a great group of colleagues on this one: LeRoy Poff, Dave Lytle, Julian Olden, Nick Bond, Avril Horne, Albert Ruhi, Lindsay Reynolds and Dave Merritt. 

**April 2019** » *New paper in Ecosphere.* We have a new paper out in [Ecosphere](https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2681). This is a multi-species demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes in the Verde River, Arizona. Projecting the model beyond the survey data predicted a shift from a native dominant to a nonnative dominant community, which was linked to increasing drought frequency. Thanks very much for leading this effort, Jane!
