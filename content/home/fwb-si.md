<b>Special Issue in <i>Freshwater Biology</i></b>  
<br><br>
Jono recently edited a special issue in <i>Freshwater Biology</i> with <a href="https://www.altermattlab.ch" target="_blank">Florian Altermatt</a> and <a href="https://www.largescaleecologylab.net/" target="_blank">Jani Heino</a> on metacommunities in river networks. You can find the special issue <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/13652427/63/1" target="_blank">here</a>, and the editorial <a href="/content/publication/tonkin18-metac-river/tonkin18-metac-river.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  
<br><br>
We compiled a series of papers with the aim of highlighting the importance of the river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes. The issue covers a wide range of topics (from disease spread and nutrient uptake to trophic dynamics), approaches (from field and lab experiments to modelling and population genetics), taxonomic foci (from diatoms and protists to fish), and geographic locations (from the tropics to the subarctic).
