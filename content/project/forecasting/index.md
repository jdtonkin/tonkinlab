Our research is increasingly forward looking, trying to forecast how biodiversity will respond to unprecedented changes associated with climate change, as well as how human intervention might influence biodiversity in a future world. Mechanistic models are one tool for this approach (see [population models](/pop-models)), particularly if looking over the longer-term. However, other approaches exist for looking at near-term dynamics, and where mechanistic data are lacking. For instance, hybrid models can leverage the availability of both mechanistic and correlative data, including integrated population models (simultaneous analysis of individual-level demographic data and population-level abundance data to infer vital rates and population dynamics), hierarchical models (e.g. hidden process models), and inverse modelling approaches (used for parameter estimation). These approaches ‘borrow strength’, fill gaps, and fuse data to get the best from different forms of data. Over the coming years, we will be employing many of these approaches to forecast biodiversity responses to novel environmental change, particularly for Antarctic species, as part of the Antarctic Science Platform.
