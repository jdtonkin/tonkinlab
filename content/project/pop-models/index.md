Contemporary ecosystem management is guided by the principle of embracing the historical range of environmental variation when setting restoration targets for degraded systems. By pushing systems away from their historical envelope of variability, rapid climate change is increasingly putting this approach into question. We develop mechanistic models to understand both population and whole-community (e.g. fish, invertebrates, riparian plants) responses to global change.
